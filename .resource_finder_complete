Research Topic: AI->Human Communication: How to?

Hypothesis: Existing AI->Human communication methods are ineffective because AI tends to generate dense, comprehensive outputs while humans prefer concise information; developing new strategies for AI to communicate large volumes of information more effectively to humans will improve human understanding and trust in AI-generated research.

Resources Gathered:
- Papers downloaded: 11
- Datasets downloaded: 3
- Repositories cloned: 3

Key Deliverables:
- literature_review.md: Comprehensive synthesis of 11 papers on progressive disclosure,
  cognitive ergonomics, summarization, and human-LLM interaction
- resources.md: Full catalog of all resources with descriptions and usage guidance
- papers/README.md: Documentation of all downloaded papers
- datasets/README.md: Dataset descriptions with download instructions
- code/README.md: Repository documentation with usage examples

Datasets Summary:
1. FeedSum (125K train + 1.4K test samples, 164MB) - Multi-dimensional feedback for summarization
2. CNN/DailyMail (11.5K test samples, 30MB) - Standard news summarization benchmark
3. Human-Like-DPO (10.9K samples, 15MB) - Human-like vs formal response preferences

Code Repositories:
1. SumLLM (github.com/yixinL7/SumLLM) - Summarization training with LLM references
2. llm-summarization-evaluation (github.com/haythemtellili/llm-summarization-evaluation) - Document summarization pipeline
3. saga-llm-evaluation (github.com/Sagacify/saga-llm-evaluation) - Comprehensive evaluation metrics (G-Eval, SelfCheck)

Recommendations for Experiments:
1. Test progressive disclosure approaches (simple first, then detailed)
2. Evaluate multi-dimensional optimization (faithfulness, completeness, conciseness)
3. Use G-Eval from saga-llm-evaluation for automated evaluation
4. Include human evaluation for comprehension and cognitive load
5. Compare formal vs conversational communication styles

Ready for experiment runner phase.
