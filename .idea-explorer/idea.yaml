  title: 'AI->Human Communication: How to?'
  domain: artificial_intelligence
  hypothesis: 'Existing AI->Human communication methods are ineffective because AI
    tends to generate dense, comprehensive outputs while humans prefer concise information;
    developing new strategies for AI to communicate large volumes of information more
    effectively to humans will improve human understanding and trust in AI-generated
    research.

    '
  background:
    description: 'AI and humans consume information differently. AI works best when
      given dense and comprehensive information with detailed instructions, but humans
      prefer concise communication. In the current surge of AI agent developments,
      human-to-AI communication is most effective when the human user can clearly
      articulate their request, but AI-to-human communication, especially when there
      is too much information to show, remains a challenge. For example, research
      agents read large collections of papers, code, and data, and possibly conduct
      experiments, often generating thousands of lines of code and lengthy reports
      that are impractical for humans to read in detail. To fully trust AI-produced
      research work, humans need to verify that nothing problematic occurs in the
      process. Scenarios such as onboarding to an ongoing research project or catching
      up with a large influx of new literature highlight the need for effective AI-to-human
      communication. While this may seem like a classic summarization problem, it
      requires careful consideration of the most effective ways to help humans understand
      dense sources of information.
