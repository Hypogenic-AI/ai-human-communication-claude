  title: 'AI->Human Communication: How to?'
  domain: artificial_intelligence
  hypothesis: 'AI and humans consume information differently; while AI benefits from
    dense and comprehensive input, humans prefer concise communication. Research is
    needed to identify and test methods that make AI-to-human communication more effective,
    especially when conveying large volumes of information, such as research agent
    outputs, so that humans can efficiently understand and trust AI-generated results.

    '
  background:
    description: 'In the current surge of AI agent developments, it is clear that
      the human->AI communication is most effective when the human user can clearly
      articulate their request, but how about AI->Human, especially when there are
      too much information to show?

      For example with research agents, they read large collections of papers, code,
      and data, and possibly do some experiments on their own. In existing research
      agent works, the tendency is to generate thousands of lines of code and possibly
      a 100-page report. No human being will possibly read all that in details, and
      to fully trust the AI-produced research work, we need to verify that nothing
      fishy happens in the middle.

      Imagine a scenario that you are joining some ongoing research project. It is
      likely not publishable, but there are some progress. How do you quickly onboard
      with what has been done? Or, you went for a break and want to catch up with
      the literature you care about (which probably has 100 new papers), how do quickly
      catch up with all that information?

      These type of problems happens a lot with the AI->Human communication. It may
      sound like a classic summarization problem, but it actually requires a lot of
      careful thinking about what are the most effective ways to help human understand
      a dense source of information
