The committee recommends Vote Pass as amended.\nSpeaker 1: Councilman Pacheco.\nSpeaker 3: So this legislation adopts new design guidelines for the Bel-Air neighborhood. These new guidelines are the result of years of community work, including 24 community meetings, five open houses, online surveys and community group conversations. The Ballard Community set about to update these guidelines in response to the significant growth the neighborhood has seen in recent years, as well as the major reasons that the Council adopted recently. The new guidelines also apply to a much broader area within the neighborhood defining seven character areas and recognizing the unique design attributes and distinct features of each. I want to thank everybody from the community who took part of the time, who took the time to craft these new guidelines.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Councilman Pacheco, any questions or comments? That's from Brian.\nSpeaker 3: Just briefly and thank you, Councilman Pacheco, for your work on this and really want to emphasize gratitude towards community members who've been working on this for so long. Not very often that a land use decision comes before us with almost no controversy at all. But I think it speaks to a lot of really deep, deep work that's based in community outreach by some of the leaders on that.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Okay.

    "document": "Speaker 5: It's okay.\nSpeaker 2: Communication from Councilwoman Gonzalez, Councilman Andrews and Councilmember Odinga. Recommendation to request the Senior Citizen Advisory Commission to create a report to review and explore the costs of restoring the former senior food programs and to discuss the connection to transportation and request the city manager to report back to the City Council no later than 90 days regarding the senior meal program.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. There's a motion and a second on this. I'm going to read this over to Councilwoman Gonzalez.\nSpeaker 8: Yes. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I wanted to bring this forward. This actually started with a friend of many of ours in downtown. Her name was Ruth Ricker. She lived at the Plymouth West. She passed away late last year, but before she passed away, I would often have coffee with her at her favorite spot off Broadway in the second District. And we would talk and she would tell me about the senior food program at Chavez Park. And she was very passionate about this program. And she said, you know, Lena, if you ever do anything in your district, please look at reinstating this program for seniors. There are many seniors in our area, especially around Chavez Park at Plymouth, West Park, Pacific Towers and many other buildings. And whatever you do, Lena, make sure that you just look into that. That's all I ask of you. And so in keeping that promise to her, unfortunately, I couldn't do this while she was alive. But I'm hoping that she will be able to look at this and be very proud. My next step was to talk to one of the individuals that I hold in very high regard, our downtown Don Darden. Our he is on the Senior Advisory Commission and I have our other amazing senior advisory commissioners here as well. And I really appreciate them being here in support of looking into this for us. But I believe that, you know, when speaking with Don, he had also mentioned that this was a great avenue to look into. In addition to this, we know that some of the transportation avenues have been changed around by Long Beach Transit. And so I know that some access to the senior center, you know, is cut off and you have to pay. And then there's some avenues along Chavez that may not make it easier for for individuals to get to those programs, even to go to the current senior programs that we have now. So this is where we are here. And I am looking to send this to the Senior Advisory Commission so they can look into this and further review this. But I'm really confident that they'll come back with some great information. And I thank you for your work.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Councilwoman Mongo.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Lina. Thank you so much for bringing this forward. Senior meal programs are a cornerstone of many of our communities, and I too am very supportive. I hope that the report will include the utilization of C one and C two funds for senior meal programs that come down from the state agency on aging and seeing where that could take us.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Councilman Andrews.\nSpeaker 9: Yes, I want to thank you also, Councilwoman Lena, for bringing support. I'm very fortunate to be able to have a senior meal in my district, but that was through private entity. And I'm just hoping that this will come back with some positive, you know, input on this because as a senior myself, I can tell you that every penny does count. And when it comes to good nutrition and meals, sometimes you have to sacrifice to pay, you know, for medication or other healthy related issues. So I am 100% in favor of this item, and we must support our seniors where we can. Thank you very much for bringing this again to the diocese.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Councilmember Ringo.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you, Mayor. And I also want to add my thank you to Councilmember Gonzales for inviting me to participate in this very important report here. I also want to include out, however, that there are many retiree retiree facilities in the seventh District. And I would like to have inclusion in there the possibility of expanding the program other than to those facilities that are already identified. Here to look at the possibility of opening up opening up another center at either Silverado Park or at Advocate Park as well, is very nice to see the possibilities of expanding the program as well , since so many seniors do live in West Palm Beach area. Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Councilman Richardson.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you, Mr. Mayor. And thank you, Councilmember Gonzalez, for bringing this forward. You know, we have meals and bus service at the Highland Park Senior Center, and I think it's essential that all parts of town have access to that. But really, this is an opportunity to look at the whole system with fresh eyes. There's new leadership with Long Beach Transit. There's a new leadership here in Long Beach. So I think we this is a perfect time to relook at the system again, see how we can improve on it. So thank you so much for bringing this forward and I'll be in support.\nSpeaker 1: Councilman Austin.\nSpeaker 11: Yes. I do want to also thank Councilmember Gonzalez and the rest of the council members for bringing this forward. We have embarked on senior programing at the expo in the eighth District. And I can tell you that engaging our seniors or aging population is extremely important. And if we can provide meals and transportation and support for them to be able to, to, to, to fellowship and to and to engage in activities and just be a part of their community, I think that's that's also important. So I will definitely be supporting this. I would also ask that you look in the. Senior Citizen Advisory Committee Commission. Look at the the eighth District at the Expo. Look at the model that we have put together on. And I know a winning cadre and a number of you have participated. I see the Burgess here in the the early formation of that that that activity, but also looking at a sustainable model that that will help us also feed our seniors and make sure that we have quality programing. So thank you again for bringing this forward. And I'm happy to support as well. Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Councilman Price.\nSpeaker 8: Thank you. I, too, want to thank my colleagues and Councilwoman Gonzales for bringing this forward. I do have a question for city staff. We referred an item to the Senior Advisor Citizen Advisory Commission. Gosh, it has to be about a year ago, maybe more regarding a report on senior programing. And I haven't heard anything back. Do we have any update on whether they've been working on that issue or.\nSpeaker 3: Here comes Kelly Colby. She might have an answer to that.\nSpeaker 5: Hey. Good evening. So there have been there have been three different requests over the past six months or so around senior issues. And what we are doing at this moment is we are updating and revising the the senior strategic plan. Within that within that document, what we'll be doing is including action steps for a full understanding of all the different services within the city of Long Beach and how we start to coordinate those services. So we'll be looking at a system about of coordination of services and then the actual services themselves and starting to look at where are where are we meeting the needs and where are we not, and to build from there. So it's sort of a well we're hoping to do is put all of that into a single document that will be coming forth and to present that to you in April. And that will be a coordinated with the department, Health and Human Services, the Senior Commission.\nSpeaker 0: And Parks Rec and Marine Park Marine.\nSpeaker 8: Okay, that's great. And I'm glad to know that this is a really good conversation to have because we as a district, as the third council district, have been thinking about senior programing in the third district. So we haven't been working with the city other than Parks Rec and Marine on it in terms of what other efforts are going on for senior programing. We're really looking forward to bringing something different to the third district in regards to senior programing. Some of the ideas that we've had, our kind of more holistic empowerment, wellness kind of, you know, meditation and taichi and yoga and those kinds of things, as opposed to the traditional courses that we often see , you know, that we offer. We wanted to offer something different in terms of offering kind of a wellness type senior center where it's kind of mind, body health, all of that. And so we've been exploring ideas, and we would love to be part of that conversation so that whatever we do is synergistic to what we're doing with the strategic plan.\nSpeaker 5: Okay. Yes. The strategic plan in many ways is also focused on those.\nSpeaker 0: Who are most at.\nSpeaker 5: Risk, seniors in terms of social services, housing, transportation, meals and all of those kinds of things. And then we'll also be in connection with Parks Rec, Marine, around senior programing in senior sites and in other community locations.\nSpeaker 8: Great. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Sure.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Any public comment on this item? Please come forward.\nSpeaker 2: Good evening, Mayor and Council. Women and councilmen and staff. Thank you all for serving this great city. I'm Mary Alice, the I'm the chairperson for the Senior Citizens Advisory Commission. And I want to say thank you to Mayor Garcia and to the Council for appointing me and our commissioners. It's been an exciting journey for us to learn how the commission is supposed to work and learning the process, the guidelines and the rules. And it's been an asset to develop our leadership skills and doing something for our seniors in the city. Also doing a lot of research, asking a lot of questions, attending meetings, going to events, and also visiting the senior centers. We will continue to engage so that we can be of help to our senior community. We are in receipt of the memorandum that was just read dated March 1st, and that's to create a report and to explore the cost of restoring the former food program and also the issues with transportation. So we will be working on that and bring you back the information. Our commissioner, Ruth Raker, passed away in July of 2015 and she was a strong advocate in support of free meals for our seniors. She lived in downtown with other seniors, and she understood the great need for good nutrition for those most needy with a limited income. Nothing is more critical to people's health and food. Hunger is a health issue. Some of our seniors come to the senior center and that's the only meal that they might have for the entire day . The consequences of poor nutrition are devastating. Older Americans are 60% more likely to experience depression and more than 50% more likely to suffer a heart attack. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which is a federal program, is called SNAP, only gives $127 a month. That doesn't cover for good nutrition. Bringing back the food program would be a great tribute and a way to honor our past commissioner, Ruth Ricker. This is the land of plenty and there shouldn't be anybody going hungry. I appreciate your time. And let's celebrate our accomplishments. Accomplishments together. Thank you very much.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Thank you very much. Next speaker, please.\nSpeaker 3: Mayor and council members. My name is Ben Rockwell. I reside at 75 West Street. Unfortunately, many of our seniors, while they don't always get the best of nutrition, a lot of people don't realize that our seniors and persons with disabilities living on SSI in addition to their Social Security, to supplement it. While they may be getting much less financial moneys, they are not eligible for the SNAP program of getting extra food dollars. This is something that is horrendous that has been foisted upon us by our state and federal governments. Not only that, just this last year, our fire department. Has started and making charges to individuals when they have to come out to pick us up to do assessments or taking us to the hospital. That assessment is $250. That is well over. One third of my income after I pay my rent. That's as an exorbitant amount of money. Yes, we can go in and request that the fee be waived. But I did that over a month and a half ago for my first meal that I received. I have yet to hear at that fee has been waived. This was something that is of concern to me and I know many other seniors because seniors are more likely to have to have pick ups and be assessed by the paramedics than any other group of persons. So, please, I would like to hear back on that. Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Next speaker, please.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you. Surely you start seeing your consultant pastor swarm group and associates with regard to seeing your care and and the meal program. I would like to raise the issue that more than likely we're thinking of people who are housed, seniors who live inside of housing. However, in most of the parks, Lincoln Park has a large homeless population who are seniors. So with the committee chair and persons who recently spoke, please make a note to yourselves. And I'm speaking to counsel. With regards to Singh, there are a large majority of the homeless population are aging people who are outside of doors. So as you think about restoring meals. We're going to have to expedite a way so that these people who are homeless will be able to get to those meals because now they're being cited groups. Some groups are being cited for taking food to people who are homeless, if they are lodging in the parks, if they're along the street. I've gotten away with a lot. I've been able to feed some people in the park, although I've been told lately that it was against the law. So when you're thinking about restoring food. We must lift our side to be young people who are housed and include those persons, those senior persons who are homeless. Some of them, as I over the recent Thanksgiving holiday, I was passing out food and money to these people. And it is a heartbreaker when you realize that unless some expedited help gets to these people, they're going to die right there. On the grass. So as we think about food programs. Don't think people who are in houses, you must include people who are outside of doors, who are seniors, and the majority of them will remain right there. Because Homeless Services is a very overlooked operation in most cities. I've traveled to three counties now over seven years, and I've seen the same problem. Seniors are a forgotten group. I saw a man sitting on the corner both in Ventura County and Orange County, and he sat on that corner in a wheelchair, homeless. We must lift our sights beyond people who are in houses with regards to the meal program.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Next speaker.\nSpeaker 5: Good evening, Mr. Mayor and fellow council members. I am Commissioner, one of a cadre of the Senior Citizen Advisory Commission. I'm here to address the problems seniors are facing, trying to keep up with the shortage of their funds. Inability to reach the senior centers where nourishing meals are served daily at a minimal cost is an ever growing problem. Seniors need these meals to survive and should not have to pay for transportation to get to them. I speak from experience. I have been an orphan since the age of four. And without government assistance, I could not be here today. So I commit my life to serving the public. I have volunteered since retirement at age 81 in our schools, hospitals, seniors centers, churches and the Long Beach Police Department. I'll be I'll be 97 next month. And with God's help, I will continue to serve. Thank you.\nSpeaker 3: Oh, my goodness. Gary Shelton's my name. 240 Chestnut. I live in Plymouth. West Coast is just about a block and a half from here at Plymouth West. I serve as the community contact. I think if I have a title and all the community contact to the to the resident advocate network it's called ran our and and I think you can tell that this issue has maybe touched a nerve. There's fully 5% of the residents from Plymouth West here right now. In fact, if you don't mind my turning around for just a second, a lot of them are in the back row. If you could raise your hand if you live in Plymouth West, you know, there's looking at the audience tonight, there's there's a lot of shades of gray and white and bald in the audience where we represent, where we'll all be one of these days, you know, God be with us. And I think I counted the votes. I think I'm kind of talking to a choir here. But the one thing that I was that I was that took me kind of by.\nSpeaker 1: Surprise.\nSpeaker 3: Was and I really appreciate that. Miss Collopy said that she hopes to present in April a a senior action plan that I would look at as sort of a bureau, address or bureau. And this issue of the senior meals and the nexus they may have to the access or lack of access to transportation to those meals will simply be one drawer in that bureau. And I'm not sure that between now and when these action plans, which take, as you know, many, many months to to create, I'm not sure there's actually time for this one to populate that dresser drawer as as well as maybe it could. But one thing I want to do is stand before you right now and suggest that we stand ready to the point that we can communicate out to the Senior Citizen Advisory Commission and to the point that they can reach out to us as well. In the various locations where seniors live, not only senior buildings, but senior neighborhoods in town, to find out just how impacted we have been by the loss of transportation and the loss of food programs specifically. So I really appreciate this opportunity to get that point across and hope that we have a lot more information on this and a lot more meals in the future. Thank you so much.\nSpeaker 1: Great. Thank you.\nSpeaker 2: I apologize. I got hit while I was walking in San Pedro and I'm still recovering. I want to thank, first of all, Councilwoman Lena Gonzalez. You're my hero. Dee Andrews, Councilman, your anger. Thank you for bringing this forward. And I know that the rest of you will support this because you have seniors living in your your various council districts. Now, Gary stole a little bit of my thunder. I want every senior who's in the building right now to raise your hands. Every senior, whether you live in Plymouth West. Great. Okay. How about the peanut gallery here?\nSpeaker 0: Our friends together.\nSpeaker 2: You know, we've got a lot of we have a lot of energy here tonight. We have a lot of talent. I have been a published writer, a magazine editor and a grant proposal writer. I hereby Takashi, I hereby will.\nSpeaker 4: Devote my life to helping the commission.\nSpeaker 2: And if there's any way that we can persuade anyone who might be a little reluctant.\nSpeaker 5: Because of cost of money.\nSpeaker 2: And whatever, there are funds out there, there are a lot of funds. The government, believe it or not, knows that we're here.\nSpeaker 4: And if they don't.\nSpeaker 2: Yet, they're going to. And we're going to let this roar. I have seen personally, through my help in the community, the need. And so many of the seniors are shut ins or they're a little reluctant to get involved. They don't have to get involved. They just have to let us know, let you know that they're there. And so we want a friendly face to the community letting them know hunger. Hunger isn't really necessary. There are there are many ways to fund these programs to help the individual who might be afraid.\nSpeaker 4: Of a government.\nSpeaker 2: Person. And I'm not a government person. And I hope that each and every one of you, whether it's Patrick West, who I met at one of Lena's events.\nSpeaker 5: Or Mister or City Attorney Parkin.\nSpeaker 2: We want your support. We want this to go forward.\nSpeaker 5: We want it to be effective. Not a money waste K, not a money wasted. And if we can help you in any.\nSpeaker 2: Way, shape or form, we're here to help. And I'm sure I'm not going to speak on behalf of Gary and Beth Seno and some of the other very creative and brilliant people who live at Columbus West. But we want to help. We want to make this.\nSpeaker 5: Happen, happen efficiently.\nSpeaker 4: And and.\nSpeaker 2: Meet the people who really need it. Okay.\nSpeaker 5: Thank you very much. Thanks for listening. And again.\nSpeaker 2: I apologize.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\nSpeaker 5: Good evening, everyone. You have your sparkling faces there. And we are sparkling seniors because there is Super Tuesday. People are voting in other parts of the country and we're here. So I just wanted to let you know, something of our commission is small but mighty, and we just got ourselves together. So the 2016 mission statement of the Senior Citizens Commission is to advocate for new thinking and science of aging for the culturally diverse population of the older adults in Long Beach, and broaden knowledge in the areas of education, safety, housing, health, transportation, technology and the quality of life. Now, to improve the quality of life and health and to cut the isolation of seniors. Where are hot lunches? Well, Councilman Lowenthal, you have the senior center in your district, and it's a wonderful place to go visit. Councilwoman Mongo, you have that wonderful Eldorado Park. Councilman Andrews, huh? You have McBride Park and Councilwoman. Councilman Richardson, you have Halton Park. And all of you have these lovely warm lunches for our older adults at parks and recreation sites. And Councilman Austin, I want to applaud what you have done and worked with to bring lunches to the expo, because that was a wonderful first step . I hope that you have had time to visit these, Mr. Mir Garcia. I hope that you'll take the time to go out and visit the seniors at those programs. Now for the health and quality of life of older adults. More needs to be done. What's missing? Councilwoman Gonzalez, Councilwoman Price, Councilman Super Na, Councilman Urunga. You all have to visit other locations because there's nothing in your area. I really want you all to please consider the positive effects of this food program and these food programs for our older adults and for the homeless. I think that's an excellent point for us. For those people that Chavez in or in honor of Ruth Ricker, that's important. Silverado and and Admiral Kidd Park. There are many others but please this needs to be done. And Long Beach. All of you every one of you sitting there looking at me and the audience. You need to have skin in the game. And I really appreciate that you're taking the time to listen to us tonight. Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Another public comment. Please come forward.\nSpeaker 7: Good to be giving skimming. Good evening, mayor and city council member don darn. Our is my name. I'm in the first district, Elian Gonzalez. We've been working on a lot of issues and we're very concerned with the seniors. Me being one course of the senior population is one of the fastest growing segments of our of our society. In case you didn't realize that it's one of the fastest growing. So there's lots of needs there and it's going to continue to get even stronger. I agree very much with this feeding program, and I'm glad you brought it up, Lena, because we, too, my wife and I felt very close to Ruth Ricker. And I think this is an opportunity to do something in memory of her and honor of her. And I think it's a great thing. Um, I, I'm, I've been to the Chavez Park many times. I go there kind of regularly. And I've noticed since the feeding program stopped there a year and a half ago, two years, whatever it is that the seniors the seniors don't come out anymore. They don't come to the park. We need senior programs at the parks and we need senior feeding at the parks. They don't seem to feel quite so comfortable just coming to the park. The feeding program was a tremendous help in doing that. So not only do we need to feed them with it, with the need those that haven't been able to get it, but we need to be able to get them there, too. Transportation is definitely an issue. As a matter of fact, just two, three months ago, back in December, Long Beach Transit had a public meeting at international school. There was 75 people that showed up, most of them seniors. And we gave all our opinions about the problems with transportation, especially the one that they were cutting out the passport. It no longer goes above third Street. It was at 10th Street. And seniors at that point in between there came down and used it very frequently. And we even suggested some alternatives that they could provide that would that would satisfy everybody, both Long Beach Transit, as well as the seniors. But unfortunately, of those 75 people that got up and spoke, they were ignored. It nothing happened. We offered an option of how they could do it to please both sides. Just, you know, as the bus now comes across Third Street, just go up seven blocks to 10th and back down over to Chavez Park and back. And they continue the route. That's all we have to do. So it seemed to me like there's some some funding, some opportunities, some grants that could not only help feed the seniors, but also if Long Beach Transit is hard up and can't afford to listen to seniors. Maybe we can help subsidize just a few more block extensions of of the present passport bus. So that's that's something that we'd like to see you help support us to do, to think about those things. If we can come up with some sort of funding, grants, anything you can think of, please come forward.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Don't.\nSpeaker 7: Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Is there any other public comment, Mr. Song?\nSpeaker 3: Honorable Mayor. City Council Member. My name is Charles Song, the chairman of the Cambodian American Civic Engagement Committee. I am here to comment on other issue, but since we brought up the senior issue, I think it's only appropriate for me to take a moment to acknowledge and applaud Councilman Diane Drew for keeping the hot meal for a senior, especially in the central area at the McBride Recreation Park, especially for the Cambodian senior. Thank you very much for doing that. I can't imagine, Andrew. And thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. See no other public comment. I'm going to take this back to the council now. Councilwoman Mongo.\nSpeaker 2: So first, I want to thank each and every one of you that serving on the commission and for your thoughtful public comment today. It's important that we have leaders who are passionate about the commissions they serve on and your attendance and your thoughtfulness and your comments that, you know, many of our our staff go to your meetings to listen in are just important. Many of you have encouraged us to go out and enjoy time with the seniors. But I'll tell you, I put on a hairnet and scooped food for the senior, delivered home, delivered meals. I'm sorry for the congregate meals where they sit together. And then I also went on right along for the home, delivered meals, and today spoke with the pastors in our district about the home delivered meal program and the areas of which we have applicants available, and then the areas where our faith based community can step up. Our Home Delivered Meals program both has an ethnic component and a non-ethnic as is our congregate meal program. And I think that localizing that and taking more local control and, and our health department taking a lead through your leadership is a big part of that. We talked a lot about transportation today, and a lot of the MTA grants for seniors go into multi-year extensions until they expire because of knowing and understanding the senior community's needs. And that changing demographic as seniors get older and move into different communities has been challenging for those organizations. And so we here in Long Beach are so fortunate to have you and your insights and your guidance. And we appreciate you very much. So thank you. And I hope we can continue to work together. I know that I've talked with some of you about some of the bus changes we're talking about with the health facilities that are all moving around in the fifth District right now. Because as those facilities move, one component of that is the added distance that seniors will need to take to walk when they get off at the bus stop. And so we're taking that into consideration and we're looking at that. And so I appreciate your comments that come to our offices. Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Councilwoman Gonzales.\nSpeaker 8: I just want to thank everyone for their beautiful comments. I think Ruth would definitely be very, very proud to hear that this is being looked into. And I look forward to the information coming back and your hard work. And thank you, everyone from Plymouth West. It's just lovely seeing everybody yet again, but on something very positive. So thanks again for every one's work and I look forward to hearing back.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. With that member's piece, Peace. Gordon, cast your votes. And as they do that, I want to thank all of you for coming out today as well. And thank you for serving and really important work. So thank you so much.\nSpeaker 2: Motion carries.\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Thank you all very much. Thank you very much. Okay. We're moving on to public comment now. The first three, I have Larry Goodhue, John Dietz and Shirley Bouchard. Jason, please come forward.",

    "document": "At long last, there's been a Scooby sighting in Iowa. Hillary Clinton's now-famous Mystery Mobile, an oversized, armored Chevy van, stopped in Iowa on Tuesday long enough for photographers to catch a glimpse of the vehicle that hauled the former secretary of state from New York to the American midwest. Unlike on Monday when Hillary stopped at an Ohio Chipotle for lunch, she popped into a coffee house in Le Claire, Iowa, for a cup of joe - and of tea. And at Tuesday's stop people actually recognized her. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . And she's off: Hillary Clinton gets ready to board the armored Chevy van which she is using to tour Iowa . MYSTERY MACHINE: Hillary Clinton's Secret Service-approved campaign van, nicknamed 'Scooby,' was photographed outside Jones Street Java House during a campaign visit on April 14 in Le Claire, Iowa . ORDINARY AMERICANS: Clinton sipped alongside Le Claire residents before heading to the town of Monticello for an education roundtable at Kirkwood Community College . Clinton talked with a panel of six at Kirkwood Community College on Tuesday in the school's auto-technology shop . ROAD TRIP: Clinton's black van started at her palatial Chappaqua, New York home and reached Monticello, Iowa as of Tuesday afternoon . Clinton focused her roundtable discussion on education issues, student loans and income inequality . Hillary and top aide Huma Abedin wore sunglasses inside the Chipotle on Monday in the Toledo suburb of Maumee and left without being engaged by anyone other than a cashier. Campaign operatives later phoned the New York Times, according to a journalist familiar with the chain of events, so reporters would know she had been there. A Times reporter later persuaded the restaurant's manager to send her photographs of his security-camera footage. Clinton ordered a chicken bowl with guacamole, a chicken salad and a fruit juice. The manager, Charles Wright, told Daily Mail Online that 'it's true nobody recognized her.' 'When the reporters started to call, I went back to the security footage, and there she was,' Wright said. 'The sunglasses probably made her harder to spot.' 'But it's not like there was anything special going on. She just stood in line like everyone else. I hope she stopped at Chipotle locations all the way from New York to wherever she's headed.' The 'Scooby' van, named as an homage to the Scooby-Doo cartoon and its 'Mystery Machine' vehicle, is an upgraded Chevrolet 1500. Hillary Clinton takes a moment out of campaigning to speak with three-year-old Kate Boens in Le Caire, Iowa . Hillary Clinton stopped for a picture with William Boens, 5 (left), Olivia VonDracek, 5, Kate Boens, 3 and Journey Peterson, 5 . Meet and greet: Hillary shakes hands with residents in\u00a0Le Claire, Iowa, while on the campaign trail . 'ALL HAIL THE QUEEN': Joey Gallagher of Iowa City, Iowa shouted as he staged a protest outside Kirkwood Community College on April 14, 2015 . Iowa City resident Matthew Evans scratched out his 'Stand w/ Rand' sign in favor of an anti-Hillary slogan as Mrs. Clinton was set to arrive for her first official presidential campaign event . THIS MANY PEOPLE KNEW ME! No one in an Ohio Chipotle restaurant recognized Clinton on Monday when she and aide Huma Abedin stopped for lunch . At\u00a0Kirkwood Community College in Monticello, Iowa, supporters turned out in force to see Hillary, with one activist telling Mail Online 'we're here to see the queen' You go girl: Two senior voters turned out to show their support for Hillary with this homemade sign . In Monticello, Kirkwood Community College became a carnival bazaar as reporters staked out the building awaiting Mrs. Clinton. Two protesters, possibly the first of her nascent campaign, held signs complaining that she was a friend of Wall Street and cast a U.S. Senate vote to support the Iraq war. 'All hail the queen!' shouted Iowa City resident Joey Gallagher, one of the pair. As journalists passed by, he carefully scribbled on the back of his sign to cover up a 'Stand With Rand' campaign slogan. Hillary Clinton visits a gift shop in Le Claire with mayor Bob Scannell (left) while out campaigning today . Hillary Clinton outside the Jones Street Java House in Le Claire earlier today as she gets her presidential nomination campaign underway . Before visiting Le Claire, Hillary help a roundtable discussion with students at\u00a0Kirkwood Community College . Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican senator, launched his own presidential campaign earlier this month in Louisville. But Matthew Evans, the second protester, insisted that 'we're not here with anybody.' 'We're here to see the queen.' As Clinton's van pulled into the Kirkwood parking lot - trailed at a short distance by a black Humvee - Evans waved a sign and repeatedly shouted, 'Give the Saudi money back!' Clinton nicknamed her campaign van 'Scooby' in honor of the popular television show Scooby Doo, in which a gang of teenagers drive around a van and solve mysteries . Hillary Clinton's custom van is Chevrolet Express Explorer Limited SE, 'a kind of full-size living room on wheels,' according to Yahoo News. It sports a 6-liter V-8 engine and a six-speed automatic transmission, more than enough horsepower for a Secret Service driver to outrun most any ne-er-do-well. Yahoo reports that the vehicle was produced with all union labor and made in the USA, as any UAW-friendly Democrat would have to ensure. Among other enhancements, Clinton's private ride is armor plated. Armor is usually placed underneath the original exterior of the vehicle. She said in a 2014 speech that it had been nearly two decades since she had driven a car, however, making it likely that she's being chauffeured around the midwest this week. That's a reference to the millions of dollars the Saudi Arabian government donated to the Clinton Foundation while Mrs. Clinton was secretary of state. Republicans cite it as one of many examples of the Clinton family philanthropy pocketing money from countries seeking special dispensation from the State Department during her tenure. The foundation now bears her name, along with those of former president Bill Clinton and their daughter Chelsea. As morning turned to afternoon in Monticello, smoke billowed on the horizon and reporters asked the locals what was burning. The likely culprit, a controlled leaf-burning. But Joe Murphy, who said he was part of the audio crew for Clinton's visit, told Daily Mail Online that 'Hillary might have crashed her Mystery Machine.' 'I should shut up,' he added. On Monday Daily Mail Online spoke with Kirkwood students anticipating Clinton's arrival. One, Corey Jones, said he was chosen to ask her a question, and would focus on illegal immigration. 'You know, Obama's plan was to make the illegal immigrants legal,' said Jones. 'She's part of all that. And some people think \u2013 well, I think maybe \u2013 it's just a tactic to have more Democratic votes' from millions of grateful new citizens. While inside the school, according to administrators, Clinton will tour the Advance Manufacturing Lab and see the Auto Technology Lab. Then she is scheduled to sit with a hand-picked group of students and faculty to take questions in a roundtable format. At\u00a0Casey's General Store in Monticello, cashier\u00a0Kathy Rigby said she was open to hearing what Hillary has to say . 'I think the whole government sucks. They need to stop running my life. It's everything, including my health care. Especially my health care.' 'But if Hillary comes, I'd go listen to her. I wouldn't vote for anyone I haven't heard from.' INCOGNITO: Hillary Clinton (center) and Huma Abedin (behind her) were spotted \u2013 only by a security camera \u2013 lunching on Monday at Chipotle in Maumee, Ohio . LISTENING: Clinton's coffee shop visit is part of an effort to make her appear more personable as she chats with ordinary Iowans in living rooms and at small businesses . MEDIA CIRCUS: Satellite trucks were on the scene in the early morning as a crush of journalists gathered to see Clinton arrive in the 'Scooby' van .",

    "document": "Air Force pilots are required to complete various phases of training before they are considered to be mission ready. To assess pilot candidates\u2019 flying aptitude for both traditional (i.e., manned) and remotely-piloted aircraft, the Air Force first requires these candidates to attend initial flight training. Successful candidates for traditional aircraft then attend one of two schools: Euro-NATO Joint Jet Pilot Training, the graduates of which become Specialized Undergraduate Pilot Training, the graduates of which become fighter, bomber, airlift, or tanker aircraft pilots, depending on pilot strengths and Air Force needs. During or following this training, a pilot is assigned to a specific aircraft, and the flight training program proceeds through three stages: Initial Qualification Training. This stage of training qualifies a pilot for basic flying duties associated with the type of aircraft (e.g., an F-16). The pilot accomplishes this stage at a formal training unit before moving to an assigned squadron. Graduates of initial qualification training courses have basic aircraft qualification status. Mission Qualification Training. This stage of training occurs once the basic aircraft qualified pilot is at the assigned unit. The pilot undergoes mission qualification training in the type of aircraft assigned to qualify for the specific missions the unit is required to perform. Continuation Training. This stage of pilot training has two components. Pilots participate in continuation training to (1) in some instances upgrade their qualifications to fill certain positions, such as flight lead, instructor, or forward air controller through specialized continuation training; and (2) in all instances maintain proficiency and improve their capabilities to perform their units\u2019 assigned missions. The Ready Aircrew Program establishes the minimum number of live training events, or \u201csorties,\u201d and virtual simulator training events, or \u201csimulator missions,\u201d that aircrews of a particular combat aircraft must complete during the annual training cycle to maintain mission readiness. These sorties and simulator missions are aligned with the units\u2019 primary missions, for which the units must maintain \u201cproficiency,\u201d and secondary missions, for which they must maintain \u201cfamiliarity.\u201d The Air Combat Command, as lead command for the Ready Aircrew Program, with the assistance of other major commands (including the Air Force Global Strike Command, Pacific Air Forces, and U.S. Air Forces in Europe) and associated subordinate organizations (i.e., air wings and squadron commanders), develops tasking memorandums for the Ready Aircrew Program that delineate and specify the annual continuation training requirements for personnel assigned to each of the subordinate combat units. On the basis of our analysis, we found that the RAND report addressed each of the three statutory elements required by Congress in Section 351. First, the RAND report addressed two statutory elements by reviewing and assessing the assumptions underlying annual continuation training requirements for the Ready Aircrew Program and the overall effectiveness of the Ready Aircrew Program in managing aircrew training requirements. These two statutory elements focus on issues raised in our prior report recommendations, which we discuss in more detail later in this report. Table 1 provides detailed information about these statutory elements, our assessment of RAND\u2019s findings, and RAND\u2019s findings associated with each element. The RAND report addressed the third statutory element by making recommendations for the improved management of training requirements. Specifically, the RAND report made nine recommendations, listed in table 2. The RAND report and its underlying analysis is consistent with generally accepted research standards for design, execution, and presentation. Table 3 summarizes our assessment of the extent to which the RAND report conformed with these standards. The RAND study and our previous audit work identified similar deficiencies in the management and operation of the Ready Aircrew Program. Specifically, in September 2016, we reported that the Air Force had used the same underlying assumptions to establish its annual training requirements in the Ready Aircrew Program from 2012 through 2016, which may not reflect current and emerging training needs. We concluded that without fully reassessing the assumptions underlying its training requirements, the Air Force could not be certain that its annual training plans are aligned with its stated goals to ensure a full-spectrum- capable force that can successfully achieve missions across a broad range of current and emerging threats. We recommended that the Air Force comprehensively reassess the assumptions underlying its annual training requirements\u2014and make any appropriate adjustments in future aircrew training plans to ensure that its forces can accomplish a full range of missions. Additionally, in our September 2016 report, we also reported that the Air Force did not systematically evaluate the effectiveness of training performed as part of the Ready Aircrew Program. We recommended that the Air Force establish desired learning objectives and training support elements needed to accomplish the training expectations identified by the Ready Aircrew Program and develop a process to collect data to assess the effectiveness of annual training against these features. We discuss these recommendations and their status in more detail later in this report. Section 351 of the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2017 required the Air Force to report on any actions it plans to take in response to RAND\u2019s recommendations and to estimate the resources required to implement the recommendations. On August 30, 2018, the Air Force provided its report\u2014a one-page transmittal letter from the Secretary of the Air Force with the RAND report incorporated as an enclosure\u2014to congressional committees in fulfillment of the Section 351 requirements. In its report, the Air Force agreed with RAND that more investment is needed in data collection because its current system does not lend itself to analysis that could be used to gain efficiencies. The Air Force also stated that it is addressing the RAND recommendations by working to link readiness to Ready Aircrew Program training requirements. Specifically, the Air Force stated that it was taking the following three actions: building training matrices to help commanders assess their units\u2019 establishing common data architecture through the Air Force\u2019s Chief Data Officer\u2013led effort, and evaluating aspects of the Ready Aircrew Program to increase lethality and improve readiness as the Air Force shifts to executing the mandates of the 2018 National Defense Strategy. However, in its August 2018 report, the Air Force did not provide any additional details to further describe or link these broad actions to the RAND findings and recommendations. Therefore, the extent to which these three actions are responsive to the RAND recommendations is unclear. In October 2019, upon completion of our audit work, Air Force officials provided us with a briefing they described as a corrective action plan that further elaborated on the Air Force\u2019s position with respect to each of RAND\u2019s nine recommendations. Air Force officials conceded that the actions described in that briefing and plan were already underway at the time of the study and were not initiated in response to the study\u2019s recommendations. They stated that, though they generally agreed with the recommendations, the Air Force lacked the manpower, resources, and means to implement them. As such, the Air Force considers each of the recommendations closed and plans no further actions. Further, the Air Force has no plans for future follow-up on implementation of the RAND recommendations. Accordingly, we did not further assess the actions described by the Air Force in relation to the RAND study. Table 4 summarizes the Air Force\u2019s position as provided in its corrective action plan briefing. As described in table 4, the Air Force concurred with three recommendations, partially concurred with five, and did not concur with one. The following summarizes the Air Force position by concurrence category: Concur: In concurring with RAND Recommendations 2 and 8\u2014to invest in data systems for the collection, access, and storage of data to correct deficiencies in current systems and improve analysis and readiness reporting\u2014the Air Force stated that, before the recommendations were made, it had made available $5.15 million in fiscal year 2020 funding to develop an Aircrew Readiness Training Management Module as an upgrade to the Air Force\u2019s Aviation Resource Management System. The Air Force expects that this module will centralize management of the Air Force Ready Aircrew Program Tasking Memorandum at the command level, transfer aircrew training data whenever a member moves to a new station, and improve capability to track the types of flight simulators used for training. Further, because the Air Force does not plan to take additional actions, it estimated no resources are required, beyond the $5.15 million already funded, prior to RAND making these recommendations. In concurring with RAND Recommendation 5\u2014to document training quality to support requests for training resources\u2014the Air Force explained that it is documenting the quality of training prescribed in its annual Air Force Ready Aircrew Program Tasking Memorandum at the squadron level. However, this is not a change based on the RAND recommendation and was being done prior to RAND making this recommendation. The Air Force factors unit training, accomplishments, and readiness inputs into the Air Force Ready Aircrew Program Tasking Memorandum and overall flying hour program. As the flying hour program is the basis for resource training requests and the Air Force factors unit training and accomplishments into its flying hour program, the Air Force explained that it plans to take no additional actions based on this recommendation. Further, because the Air Force does not plan to take additional actions, it estimated no resources were required to implement this recommendation. Partially Concur: In partially concurring with RAND recommendations 1, 3, 4, 6, and 9, Air Force officials explained that the mechanisms reflected in its comments are sufficient to address the intent of the RAND recommendations even though these mechanisms predated RAND\u2019s recommendations. Consequently, according to the Air Force officials who briefed us, the Air Force plans no additional actions based on the recommendations, obviating the need to estimate resources in the case of these five recommendations. Nonconcur: In not concurring with RAND Recommendation 7\u2014to consider changing how Air Force Flying Hour Program requirements affect the flying hour program\u2014the Air Force explained that the flying hour program determination is standard across the Total Air Force, affecting more than combat aircrews alone, and that the centrality of the flying hour program to readiness and combat capability cannot be overemphasized and must be defendable and auditable. Further, based on its not concurring with this recommendation, the Air Force did not estimate resources for this recommendation. Notwithstanding the RAND study, the actions taken by the Air Force may not fully implement our prior recommendations as described previously. Specifically, we recommended that the Air Force comprehensively reassess the assumptions underlying its annual training requirements\u2014 including for example the total annual training requirements by aircraft, the criteria for designating aircrews as experienced or inexperienced, and the mix between live and simulator training\u2014and make any appropriate adjustments in future aircrew training plans to ensure that its forces can accomplish a full range of missions. While RAND accomplished such an analysis as part of its review (see table 1, items 1(a) through 1(e) above), RAND concluded in its analysis that the Air Force did not have the objective measures of proficiency needed to determine the minimum and optimum number of sorties and that the combat air forces aviation community lacks consensus on how to define and measure an aircrew member\u2019s proficiency. While the Air Force has defined proficiency in an Air Force manual issued in September 2019, the Air Force has not reassessed its assumptions underlying training requirements and made appropriate adjustments to future training plans per our recommendation. Further, we recommended that the Air Force establish desired learning objectives and training support elements needed to accomplish the training expectations in its annual Ready Aircrew Program tasking memorandums, and develop a process to collect data to assess the effectiveness of annual training. In commenting on RAND\u2019s recommendations 2 and 8, the Air Force stated that, before the recommendations were made, it had made available $5.15 million in fiscal year 2020 funding to develop an Aircrew Readiness Training Management Module as an upgrade to the Air Force\u2019s Aviation Resource Management System. The Air Force\u2019s effort to upgrade this system, while not a result of the RAND recommendations, may meet the intent of our recommendation. For example, the Air Force\u2019s development of the Aviation Resource Management System is expected to centralize management of the Air Force\u2019s Ready Aircrew Program training requirements data at the command level, transfer aircrew training data whenever a member moves to a new station, and improve capability to track the types of flight simulators used for training. When fully implemented, these improvements may ultimately allow the Air Force to assess the effectiveness of annual training, as we recommended. However, it is too early to tell as the actions were under development or had just begun at the end of September 2019, and sufficient data to evaluate the results have not been collected. Fully implementing both of our recommendations would better position the Air Force to ensure that its aircrews receive effective training to achieve a range of missions for current and emerging threats. We provided a draft of this report to DOD for review and comment. In its written comments (reprinted in appendix II), DOD stated that it saw great value in our discussion. DOD added that its position on the two recommendations we made in our 2016 report\u2014with which DOD did not concur\u2014is fundamentally unchanged. However, we continue to believe the recommendations should be implemented by the Air Force, as previously discussed in this report. In its comments, DOD also stated that it is addressing training infrastructure and aircrew proficiency through two initiatives. First, in response to the 2018 National Defense Strategy, the department's Joint Operational Infrastructure Plan is framing the modernization effort of DOD-wide Operational Infrastructure. The Joint Operational Infrastructure Plan specifically addresses areas such as Live Virtual Constructive and aircrew training. Second, the department is pursuing efforts to align training events with the range of current and evolving threats. According to DOD, both efforts will address the underlying assumptions for aircrew training and proficiency with reportable readiness metrics. However, the Joint Operational Infrastructure Plan is a draft and not yet officially issued, according to an official at the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness. Therefore, details needed to assess this plan are not yet available for us to consider in determining whether the change will help to address the recommendations we made in 2016. Regarding efforts the department is pursuing to better align training events, the DOD comments did not include sufficient details to allow us to state whether the change could be helpful in addressing our recommendations. Nonetheless, to the extent that DOD is successful in completing, issuing, and implementing its new Joint Operational Infrastructure Plan, or takes further actions related to our prior recommendations, we will consider them as we continue to analyze DOD efforts to address our recommendations. We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional committees, the Secretary of Defense, the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, and the Secretary of the Air Force. In addition, the report is available at no charge on the GAO website at http://www.gao.gov. If you or your staff have any questions about this report, please contact me at (202) 512-5431 or russellc@gao.gov. Contact points for our Offices of Congressional Relations and Public Affairs may be found on the last page of this report. GAO staff who made major contributions to this report are listed in appendix III. To determine whether the RAND report followed generally accepted research standards, we chose the following criteria, which are based on a review of research literature and Department of Defense (DOD) guidance, from which we identified frequently occurring, generally accepted research standards that are relevant for defense studies, including those related to the presentation of results. These standards have been used in a number of our prior reports, modified as appropriate for each situation. For the purposes of this engagement, we assessed the RAND study against three major elements, listed below, that fall under generally acceptable research standards, as based on our prior work. These generally accepted research standards are consistent with Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Guidelines and DOD guidance on ensuring and maximizing the quality of information disseminated by federal agencies to the public. We discussed these standards with RAND officials, who agreed that they were generally consistent with their own quality standards for research and were applicable to this study. We determined that these standards are still current and relevant for the purposes of this report, based on their consistency with OMB and DOD guidance, discussions with RAND officials, and consideration of prior GAO work applying generally accepted research standards with the assistance of GAO\u2019s Applied Research and Methods Team. The standards include the following: Design\u2014Study is well designed. For the RAND study, we focused on the following elements for design: The study plan, scope, and objectives follow existing guidance. Assumptions and constraints are reasonable and consistent. Execution\u2014Study is well executed. For the RAND study, we focused on the following elements for execution: The methodology is successfully executed. Data used to support study and analyses are validated. Presentation\u2014Results are well presented. For the RAND study, we focused on the following elements for presentation: Timely, complete, accurate, concise, and relevant to stakeholders. Presentation of results supports findings. In addition to the contact named above, Beverly Schladt (Assistant Director), John Strong (Analyst in Charge), John Beauchamp, Vincent Buquicchio, Martin De Alteriis, and Lillian Moyano Yob made key contributions to this report.",

    "human_reference": "In September 2016, GAO reported that annual combat aircrew training requirements delineated in the Air Force's Ready Aircrew Program might not address pilot training needs, and that the Air Force did not systematically evaluate the effectiveness of its training. As a result, Congress included a provision in Section 351 of the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2017 for the Air Force to commission an independent review of its Ready Aircrew Program, report on actions it planned to take in response to any recommendations, and provide an estimate of any resources required. Section 351 also included a provision for GAO to assess the Air Force report. This report examines whether (1) the independent review conducted by the RAND Corporation addressed statutory requirements to review and assess the Ready Aircrew Program, and (2) the Air Force has reported on completed or planned actions to implement the RAND report recommendations. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed the RAND and Air Force reports on the Ready Aircrew Program, assessed the study against generally accepted research standards, and interviewed officials at RAND, Air Force Headquarters, and the Air Combat Command. A July 2018 RAND report\u2014commissioned by the Air Force\u2014addressed the statutory requirements of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2017 to review and assess the Air Force's Ready Aircrew Program and make recommendations for ways to improve it. The Ready Aircrew Program establishes minimum annual training requirements for combat aircrew. RAND's report, entitled Independent Review and Assessment of the Air Force Ready Aircrew Program , made nine recommendations to improve its management: 1. Leverage internal expertise to implement measures for proficiency. 2. Invest resources to design data collection and storage solutions that facilitate analysis and readiness reporting. 3. Document the Ready Aircrew Program Tasking Memorandum development process in Air Force instruction supplements and ensure that the process incorporates squadron-level input and feedback. 4. Establish a more explicit and formal link between proficiency and Ready Aircrew Program requirements. 5. Document training quality to support requests for training resources. 6. Identify the conditions under which Ready Aircrew Program requirements, including mission types, can be accomplished. 7. Consider changing how Ready Aircrew Program requirements affect the Flying Hour Program. 8. Invest in data systems to correct data collection and assess deficiencies. 9. Leverage the Air Force Research Laboratory's performance data work and invest in added analysis to produce enterprise-wide proficiency metrics. The nine RAND recommendations aligned with two GAO recommendations made in 2016 to comprehensively assess the assumptions underlying the annual aircrew training requirements and develop a process to collect data to assess the effectiveness of the training. The Air Force's August 2018 one-page report to Congress included three broad actions in response to RAND's recommendations. The Air Force planned to build training matrices to help commanders assess their units' effectiveness, establish common data architecture through the Air Force's Chief Data Officer\u2013led effort, and evaluate aspects of the Ready Aircrew Program to increase lethality and improve readiness as the Air Force shifts to executing the mandates of the 2018 National Defense Strategy. The Air Force, however, did not explain how these three efforts would specifically address the nine recommendations. Air Force officials said that, though they generally agreed with RAND's recommendations, the Air Force lacked the resources to fully implement them beyond actions that were underway prior to the RAND report, and considers all recommendations as \u201cclosed.\u201d In part due to its not fully implementing RAND's recommendations, the Air Force has not fully addressed GAO's two recommendations. Fully implementing GAO's recommendations would better position the Air Force to ensure its aircrews receive effective training to achieve a range of missions. GAO is not making any new recommendations in this report but restates the need to fully implement GAO's two 2016 recommendations. In comments on a draft of this report, DOD did not concur with the two 2016 recommendations. GAO maintains that the Air Force should implement both recommendations. recommendation. GAO will consider these in its annual recommendations follow-up.",

    "document": "Speaker 3: Thank you very much. Let's move on to item. 12.\nSpeaker 1: Item 12 is a report from financial management. Recommendation to receive and file the fiscal year 2020 year end budget performance report and increase appropriation in several funds to reflect final expenditures and carryover up CDI.\nSpeaker 3: Okay. I know. Mr. Modica. I think Mr. GROSS was gonna give us an update.\nSpeaker 4: Yes, sir. Mr. GROSS and Grayson are able to give us that report.\nSpeaker 0: Hello, Mayor. And members of the City Council. Can you all hear me?\nSpeaker 3: Yes, we can.\nSpeaker 0: Okay, great. Good evening, Mayor and members of the City Council. This is the year end performance report for FY 20 for all funds. As we know, this past year was an unprecedented year with the city facing issues, a worldwide pandemic, the injustices and increased exposure of systemic racism and economic disruption. These events altered the city's priorities and focus in Fy20 and has had a significant impact on the city's finances and our financial strength. As a reminder, the Fy20 budget was adopted before employee contract negotiations were complete and the budget did not include funding for these potential costs. Therefore, when negotiations were complete, cost of about 10 to 12 million were unfunded. However, based on strong fy19 performance, there were encouraging signs at that time that strong revenue performance in Fy20 could help cover these costs. Unfortunately, the pandemic hit and that strong revenue did not occur after it became clear that the world was in a pandemic situation. The initial shortfall projection indicated that the general fund could have a potential shortfall of 25 to 41 million, largely due to pandemic related revenue loss. Fortunately, the final shortfall didn't turn out to be as bad as initial signs showed. The ending of FY 20 shortfall in the general fund is 19.7 million. However, I would like to note that this is an incredibly unusual and unique year with many accounting complexities that we are still researching, adjusting entries and the financial systems were still occurring subsequent to finalizing this report that could impact the shortfall by 2 to 3 million. Potentially to the good. But the ultimate situation of a large shortfall will not change. This ending shortfall is better than the early projections due to several factors, both on the revenue and expenditure side. The revenue shortfalls were not as severe as originally thought to be possible. Additionally, some revenues outperformed expectations such as cannabis revenues. Lastly, the revenue loss was mitigated by actions such as not funding the annual oilfield abandonment liability costs to preserve as much of the expected oil transfer, as well as additional gasoline transfers due to strong performance in the gas fund while staying within charter limits. In terms of expenditure, proactive measures were taken during the year. The city manager issued mid-year savings target and a hiring freeze to departments who work to scale back on costs and generate savings. The City Council also suspended some previously approved one time projects. Federal and state grants such as FEMA and CARES also help cover eligible pandemic costs. And a separate report providing full detail on pandemic related expenses and offsets will be issued soon in a separate tff. Ultimately, while these actions help to reduce the shortfalls, revenue were not sufficient in covering expenses, which included unexpected costs related to First Amendment demonstrations, response to civil unrest, the negotiated contract costs that were not budgeted, as well as additional funds needing to be reserved, such as the measure and litigation lawsuit. This general fund shortfall is being addressed by utilizing 12.6 million of the 13.5 million operating reserves and about 6.8 million of the 46 million emergency reserve. This essentially depletes the operating reserves and bring both reserves below the recommended minimum levels. Replenishing these reserves and restoring financial resiliency should be a high priority for any future surplus use or for any federal stimulus funds the city might receive. Other funds were also adversely impacted by the pandemic or have fiscal challenges for other reasons. These include the Tidelands Operating Fund, the Special Advertising and Promotions Fund, the Insurance Fund, the Civic Center Fund and the Towing Fund. Unlike the Tidelands and the special advertising and promotion funds are anticipated to have continuing challenges in FY 21, with the pandemic related revenue loss and expenses, they will need to be closely monitored with potential mitigating adjustments in FY 21. To conclude with some good news, the measure program ended with a surplus of 5.3 million due to a mix of revenue coming in over budget expenditure, savings from the delayed police academy and not contributing to the measure b stabilization reserves which occurs by design when there are fiscal difficulties such as the one we faced in Fy20. The city manager is proposing to allocate these dollars towards critical infrastructure projects as listed in the report, with investments for street improvements, improvements in sidewalk, curb ramp and ADA compliance program, traffic circle, wayfinding signs, tree trimming program, and support for repairing and upgrading citywide security cameras. In FY 20, the City Council had adopted a motion designated future measure surplus funds to be focused on alleys and park improvements. But with the pandemic impacting the availability of funds for various critical needs. The recommendations focus on immediate needs, which other funding is not available. If the City Council concurs with these allocations, the measure recommendations will be incorporated into a FY 21 Budget Adjustment Report as contingent appropriations subject to the Citizens Advisory Committee review in April to ensure that a use is in compliance with the intent of measuring spending. This concludes my staff report and I'm available for questions.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you. I have a motion to approve by Councilmember Ringa. Is there a second place? Second by Councilwoman Zendejas. Let me before I go back to Councilmember Durango, I just want to make some broad comments. First is I certainly there's no question that this is a better update than we had a few months ago. And it's great to see, obviously, many of our funds and projections perform better than we were expecting. So I think that's really great news. I think also it's important to note that we are using our emergency reserve on exactly what the name of the reserve is called, and that's in case of emergencies. These are kind of once in a generation events. This certainly this pandemic has been the truly the largest challenge to us that we have faced as a city and community. And so it's very appropriate that that in these emergencies, we have this fund to help us get by and get through. Let me also just add, and I think also that which is really critical and this this is not not a conversation for tonight, but it certainly will be a few weeks from now is that the White House and Congress are putting final touches on the American rescue plan, and we don't have final details yet on what those numbers look like. But we do know that there is going to be significant support for cities. And we are working very hard to ensure that Long Beach receives a significant share of that plan. We should know kind of the conclusion of that in the in the in the weeks ahead. And and as part of that, many of our kind of shortfall challenges, including the ability to look at how we build back that reserve, is all possible within this plan. And so I think I look forward to sharing more when when it is set by the Congress. And I know this council also looks forward to having that conversation in the future. And so I just wanted to add that a little context to what's in front of us. And so thank you again to our budget staff for this presentation. Customer Oranga Did you have any comments? You made the motion.\nSpeaker 2: I just thank you there for the hard work that you're doing and making sure that we get this fair share of the assistance that's going to be coming from the federal government. And as a member of the Oversight Budget Oversight Committee, I am committed to looking further into other creative ways that we can manage this budget and weather this pandemic, as well as all the other challenges that we face this past year. Thank you.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you, Councilman. Sunday House.\nSpeaker 0: To thank you, Mayor and staff, for working really hard on this. I know it's been a very difficult year, so I appreciate all the hard work that has gone into saving as much as we can, wherever we can. And I'm looking forward to the funds coming down to us. So thank you.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you for super now.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Mayor. I just have one comment on the report and it is regarding an item on page 12. The Measure A and it is an enhancement of $800,000 to be spent on signage and landscaping at the traffic circle in the fourth Council District. First, I'd like to thank staff for supporting the city for project. Unfortunately, I have not received any information on the proposed project, so I cannot vote in support of the agenda item for a project of this magnitude. I would have expected to receive a briefing renderings and the opportunity to share the project with the public. That did not happen. So regretfully, I will not be able to support the item and also like to add that I am not commenting on the merits of the project. Potentially, this could be the greatest public works projects in the history of mankind. The problem is, I don't know what it is, so it puts me in an awkward position of turning down $800,000 for my district, but I can't do that without knowing anything about the project. So thank you for that. And that concludes my comments.\nSpeaker 3: Councilman Austin.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. I just wanted to thank staff, particularly Ms.. HUME, for the great presentation, our finance team for for really staying on top of our budget. It's good for us to know where we've been, to know where we're going. And just a couple of remarks here. Measure a you know, again, I want to thank the voters in Long Beach for for passing Measure A, because I don't know where we'd be without that fund. We'd be really handicapped to be able to do anything comes related to infrastructure repair as well as, you know, maintaining the level of public safety that we do have today. And then congratulate the the council and the city staff or for its work related to cannabis as well. Cannabis is is a new industry that is really way outperforming projections that were that were projected back in 19 and 20. So, you know, again, being innovative, being creative, being bolder, looking at new revenue opportunities was was incredibly important for us. We still had a deficit year on balance of $19 million in FY 20, but it could have been much, much worse. I'm, again, very interested in seeing how we how we rebound over the next several months and hopefully and and we'll be working with you, Mr. Mayor, to. To get all the support we can from the federal and state governments to replenish our reserves and continue to provide a great service that we do for the residents of Long Beach. Thank you.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you, Councilman Mongo.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I guess my biggest concern is something that I communicated to the city manager when he brought forward this. The city council voted when we brought forward measure what we wanted those next set of priorities to be. And those priorities are not here. And so while a lot of these projects are important, we told the voters and and we also told the community when we had these hearings and people came forward to talk about the budget, that the next round of measure funding, if it became available, would be for park bathrooms, would be for pump values. We talked about these things. And so my big hesitation is we went through a process and the Budget Committee and the budget chair brought that forward. And we discussed it as a council and we made those recommendations. And I get that it's important to make adjustments on the floor. And as time goes by. But in the discussions with city staff, it sounds as though those priorities were an afterthought. And so that gives me heartburn. And so I feel like this was the same type of thing that came up when we discussed the worst streets first. We talked about that there are streets across the city that are very poor and alleys across the city that are very poor. And we agreed that those were the priorities. So is, as Mr. Otunga, the maker of the motion.\nSpeaker 3: He is.\nSpeaker 0: I guess I would ask the city staff, what's the urgency of approving this tonight and if there potentially are other councilmembers that feel that this needs to go back and get another look? And if there is, then I would hope Councilmember Odinga would be open to having some city staff bring back a revision next week. And let's continue this item.\nSpeaker 3: Councilmember. How can we have a motion on the floor? We're going to go ahead and go to a vote. Kashmir ranga. Unless you have a. A change or a friendly on that.\nSpeaker 0: I'm asking if you'd be open to a.\nSpeaker 3: Sorry.\nSpeaker 0: Attenuation. A friendly amendment to continue for a week.\nSpeaker 3: Cut from your income?\nSpeaker 2: No, I don't think so. I think what we can do is we can work this out through the Budget Advisory Committee for the whole country.\nSpeaker 3: Okay. We're going to go to a roll call vote. Madam Clerk.\nSpeaker 1: Councilwoman Sunday House.\nSpeaker 0: Hi.\nSpeaker 1: Councilwoman Ellen.\nSpeaker 0: I.\nSpeaker 1: Councilwoman Price.\nSpeaker 0: I.\nSpeaker 1: Councilman subpoena.\nSpeaker 2: Names.\nSpeaker 1: Councilman Mangum.\nSpeaker 0: No.\nSpeaker 1: Councilwoman Sara.\nSpeaker 0: I.\nSpeaker 1: Councilmember Oranga.\nSpeaker 2: I.\nSpeaker 1: Councilman Alston.\nSpeaker 2: I.\nSpeaker 1: Vice Mayor Richardson.

PHILLIPS: Live pictures just outside of Los Angeles, California. This is the Alhambra are affiliate, KVC, bringing up these live pictures. This is what we know so far. The two-alarm fire at a strip mall. It started just before noon Eastern Time, 9 a.m. local time. This is Valley Boulevard, just north of the 10 (ph) freeway. Part of the building, as you can see, has collapsed. No word on the injuries or cause at this time. We're told that the nearby business across the street had to -- had to evacuate as firefighters work this fire. We'll keep you updated on what's happening among firefighters. Now, the latest sex abuse cases to rock the Catholic Church. At this moment right now, leaders of the nation's largest archdiocese are in Los Angeles superior court, finalizing a landmark settlement. The Los Angeles Archdiocese will pay $660 million, the largest payout of its kind. More than 500 alleged victims will split the money, and it averages out to more than $1.3 million per plaintiff. The payouts will be based on the severity of the abuse. The deal ends more than five years of negotiations, but CNN's Kara Finnstrom tells us neither church leaders nor the plaintiffs are celebrating.</s>CARDINAL ROGER MAHONEY, LOS ANGELES DIOCESE, CATHOLIC CHURCH: Once again, I apologize.</s>KARA FINNSTROM, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): With those words the Cardinal Roger Mahony announced the L.A. Archdiocese's record settlement: $660 million to 508 people who have accused priests of sexual abuse.</s>MAHONY: It should not have happened and should not ever happen again.</s>FINNSTROM: The cardinal was then repeatedly asked whether he'd made mistakes handling the allegations.</s>MAHONY: Spiritually, because sometimes I honestly had reached the bottom. I didn't know what to do, what to do next. It seemed like everything I tried to do was wrong.</s>FINNSTROM: Sunday's announcement came one day before the civil trials were slated to start, trials where Mahony might have had to testify.</s>ESTHER MILLER, ALLEGED VICTIM: Mahony decided for a purely business decision to settle this so that he wouldn't stand in front of God and colleagues and the media.</s>FINNSTROM: Esther Miller is one of the alleged victims who belongs to SNAP, the Survivors Network for those Abused by Priests.</s>MARY GRANT, ALLEGED VICTIM: There's a picture of me around the age of 13, when I began to be repeatedly raped by a priest.</s>FINNSTROM: Mary Grant is another.</s>GRANT: No amount of money or guilty verdict will give back those kids that lost their childhood.</s>FINNSTROM: Mahony says the church is now using new screening programs and education to prevent future abuse. He says the settlement costs will largely be split between the archdiocese, insurers and the religious orders whose priests were accused. (on camera) The $660 million settlement that brings a legal end to these cases is by far the largest settlement in the child molestation scandal that's rocked this church. The next largest, $157 million in the Archdiocese of Boston. Kara Finnstrom for CNN, Los Angeles.</s>PHILLIPS: And a reminder: Kara is inside the courtroom. We're going to hear from her and possibly others as soon as the hearing ends. As for the priests accused of sexual abuse, Cardinal Mahony says almost all were eventually convicted. Sorry about the president's video there bumping up.</s>HOLMES: I think we want to get back to that now. Propping up the Palestinian government, a big job. In just a few minutes, President Bush will announce a big financial and diplomatic push. On the financial front, he will pledge $190 in additional U.S. aid. He'll also call for a conference this fall among Israel and its Arab neighbors. Right now Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas is governing just half of the Palestinian territories. He retreated to the West Bank last month as Hamas fighters trapped his security forces and supporters in Gaza. Hamas is still in control there, jeopardizing the U.S.-backed two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. And of course, when the president speaks, we will bring that to you live here in the CNN NEWSROOM. Well, here in Georgia now. Time running out for Death Row inmate Troy Davis. He's due to be executed tomorrow for the shooting death of a police officer in Savannah almost 20 years ago. He swears he's innocent. And now many of the prosecution witnesses agree. CNN's Rusty Dornin reports.</s>MARTINA CORREIA, SISTER OF TROY DAVIS: I'm trying to answer all these e-mails and things about Troy.</s>RUSTY DORNIN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): On a mission, Martina Correia works 18-hour days with one aim: to save her brother Troy's life. Troy Davis was convicted of killing Savannah police Officer Mark McPhail in 1989. He's scheduled to be executed on Tuesday. There was no physical evidence, no murder weapon found. Correia says that alone should cast doubt on the jury's guilty verdict.</s>CORREIA: When you only have eyewitness testimony, you have no physical evidence, people have fallacies. We make mistakes.</s>DORNIN: A case of a mistaken identity. That's what Davis' lawyers and supporters claim. This was the scene in 1989, this parking lot of the Greyhound bus station in Savannah, Georgia. Some witnesses say Davis and two other men were following a homeless man across the street, harassing him. Off-duty Officer Mark McPhail ran out to break up the fight. That's when some witnesses claim Troy Davis shot the policeman twice and ran. In Savannah, the manhunt was on. Davis surrendered to investigators days later. (on camera) Since Davis' conviction, the defense claims seven witnesses have changed and sometimes even contradicted their own story. During the trial, the defense claims it was another man that shot McPhail in this parking lot. Now some of the witnesses are pointing their finger at the same man, claiming that fear or reprisal and police coercion caused them to accuse Davis. (voice-over) Monty Holmes is one witness who changed his story. Now he claims he was coerced by police.</s>MONTY HOLMES, WITNESS: They were trying to get me to say that he did it. He didn't do it.</s>DORNIN: Major Everett Ragan, head of the homicide investigation unit back then. He dismisses allegations of coercion. And as for witnesses changing their stories, he doesn't believe it.</s>MAJ. EVERETT RAGAN, SAVANNAH POLICE: There's no doubt in my mind that this is the right person.</s>DORNIN (on camera): There's no element of doubt that it could have been the other man?</s>RAGAN: No.</s>DORNIN (voice-over): Sergeant David Owens has no doubts, either. He was a close friend of the victim, a man everyone called Mac. It was Owens you see here trying to save McPhail's life in the back of the ambulance in 1989. Owens now hopes the victim won't be forgotten.</s>HOLMES: Rusty Dornin joins us now after that report. We're talking about Davis here. A lot of questions. And he's been rejected left and right by the courts.</s>DORNIN: That's right.</s>HOLMES: What kind of chance does he have now? Any other court? Any other options?</s>DORNIN: Well, his last hope for a court hearing was dashed on Friday night in Savannah. Apparently, it denied him what they call an extraordinary motion for a new trial. Right now there's a clemency hearing in Atlanta. This morning the defense witnesses are testifying. This afternoon, the prosecution will testify. And the only thing the parole board can do is actually just commute his sentence to life without the possibility of parole. They can't pardon him or anything like that.</s>HOLMES: And you were telling me earlier about the history of hearings like this with the clemency board.</s>DORNIN: Right. And since 1977 they've had 47 of these hearings. And only eight of them have had their sentences commuted.</s>HOLMES: And also, you've talked to him over the phone, Death Row there. How is he holding up? How is he doing?</s>DORNIN: We spoke to him twice. The last time I spoke to him was on Friday afternoon. And the thing is I asked him -- they keep pointing the finger at this other man.</s>HOLMES: Right.</s>DORNIN: And apparently during his trial, he never did that. And we do have a piece of sound from that interview. Let's listen.</s>TROY DAVIS, DEATH ROW INMATE: Because I didn't want to be labeled as a snitch.</s>DORNIN: And that's the only reason?</s>DAVIS: Yes, which is stupid.</s>DORNIN: He didn't point the finger at this other person during his trial. It only came out later. Now you've got all these witnesses changing their stories and contradicting themselves. But as we said, his last hope is today. And we understand there may be a decision by sometime tonight.</s>HOLMES: He is on Death Row, and not to say -- it would have made difference. We're going to have to go ahead. I wish we could talk to more. We've got to get to the president here. Rusty Dornin, thank you so much.</s>PHILLIPS: The president calling for international support in a conference in the Middle East. Addressing reporters now.</s>GEORGE W. BUSH, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: ... first American president to call for the creation of a Palestinian state. In the Rose Garden I said that Palestinians should not have to live in poverty and occupation. I said that the Israelis should not have to live in terror and violence. And I laid out a new vision for the future: two democratic states, Israel and Palestine, living side by side in peace and security. Since then, many changes have come. Some hopeful, some dispiriting. Israel has taken difficult actions, including withdrawal from Gaza and parts of the West Bank. Palestinians have held pre- elections and chosen a president committed to peace. Arab states put forward a plan that recognizes Israel's place in the Middle East. And all these parties, along with most of the international community, now share the goal of a peaceful, democratic Palestinian state, a level of consensus never before seen on this crucial issue. Past five years have also brought developments far too familiar in the recent history of the region. Confronted with the prospect of peace, extremists have responded with acts of aggression and terror. In Gaza, Hamas radicals betrayed the Palestinian people with a lawless and violent takeover. By its actions, Hamas demonstrated beyond all doubt that it is devoted to extremism and murder than to serving the Palestinian people. This is a moment of clarity for all Palestinians. And now comes a moment of choice. The alternatives before the Palestinian people are stark. There's vision of Hamas, which the world saw in Gaza, with murderers and black -- murderers in black masks and summary executions and men thrown to their death from rooftops. By following this path, the Palestinian people would guarantee chaos and suffering and the endless perfect perpetuation of grievance. They would surrender their future to Hamas' foreign sponsors in Syria and Iran. And they would crush the possibility of any -- of a Palestinian state. There's another option, and that's a hopeful option. It is the vision of President Abbas and Prime Minister Fayad. It's the vision of their government. It's the vision of a peaceful state called Palestine as a homeland for the Palestinian people. To realize this vision, these leaders are striving to build the institutions of a modern democracy. They're working to strengthen the Palestinian security services so they can confront the terrorists and protect the innocent. They're acting to set up competent ministries that deliver services without corruption. They're taking steps to improve the economy and unleash the natural enterprise of the Palestinian people. And they're assuring that Palestinian society operates under the rule of law. By following this path, Palestinians can reclaim their dignity and their future and establish a state of their own. Only the Palestinians can decide which of these courses to pursue. Yet all responsible nations have the duty to help clarify the way forward. By supporting the reforms of President Abbas and Prime Minister Fayad, we can help them show the world what a Palestinian state would look like and act like. We can help them prove to the world the region in Israel that a Palestinian state would be a partner, not a danger. We can help them make clear to all Palestinians that rejecting violence is the surest path to security and a better life. And we can help them demonstrate to the extremists once and for all that terror will have no place in a Palestinian state. So in consultation with our partners in the quartet, the European Union, Russia, and the United Nations, the United States is taking a series of steps to strengthen the forces of moderation and peace among the Palestinian people. First, we're strengthening our financial commitment. Immediately after President Abbas expelled Hamas from the Palestinian government, the United States lifted financial restrictions on the Palestinian Authority that we had imposed. This year we will provide the Palestinians with more than $190 million in American assistance, including funds for humanitarian relief in Gaza. To build on this support, I recently authorized the Overseas Private Investment Corporation to join in a program that will help generate $228 million in lending to Palestinian businesses. Today, I announce our intention to make a direct contribution of $80 million to help Palestinians reform their security services. A vital effort they're undertaking the guidance of American General Keith Dayton. We will work with Congress and partners around the world to provide additional resources, once a plan to build a Palestinian institutions is in place. All this assistance, we are showing the Palestinian people that a commitment to peace leads to the generous support of the United States. Second, we're strengthening our political and diplomatic commitment. Again, today President Abbas and Prime Minister Olmert sat down together to discuss priorities and resolve issues. Secretary Rice and I have strongly supported these meetings, and she has worked with both parties to sketch out a political horizon for a Palestinian state. Now we will intensify these efforts with the goal of increasing the confidence of all parties in a two-state solution. And we will continue to deliver a firm message to Hamas. You must stop Gaza from being a safe haven for attacks against Israel. You must accept the legitimate Palestinian government, permit humanitarian aid in Gaza and dismantle the militias. And you must reject violence and recognize Israel's right to exist and commit to all previous agreements between the parties. As I said in the Rose Garden five years ago, a Palestinian state will never be created by terror. Third, we're strengthening our commitment to helping build the institutions of a Palestinian state. Last month former prime minister -- British prime minister, Tony Blair, agreed to take on a new role as quartet representative. In his post he will coordinate international efforts to help the Palestinians establish the institutions of a strong and lasting free society, including effective governing structures, a sound financial system, and the rule of law. He will encourage young Palestinians to participate in the political process. And America will strongly support his work to help the Palestinian leaders answer their people's desire to live in peace. All the steps I have outlined are designed to lay the foundation for a successful Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza. A nation with functioning political institutions and capable security forces and leaders who reject terror and violence. With the proper foundation, we can soon begin serious negotiations towards the creation of a Palestinian state. These negotiations must resolve difficult questions and uphold clear principles. They must assure that Israel is secure. They must guarantee that a Palestinian state is viable and contiguous. And they must lead to a territorial settlement with mutually agreed borders, reflecting previous lines and current realities and mutually agreed adjustments. America is prepared to lead discussions to discuss these issues. But they must be resolved by Palestinians and Israelis themselves. Resolving these issues would help show Palestinians a clear way forward and ultimately could lead to a final peace in the Middle East, a permanent end to the conflict and an agreement on all issues, including refugees in Jerusalem. To make this prospect a reality, the Palestinian people must decide that they want a future of decency and hope, not a future of terror and death. They must match their words denouncing terror with action to combat terror. The Palestinian government must arrest terrorists, dismantle their infrastructure and confiscate illegal weapons as the road map requires. They must work to stop attacks on Israel and to free the Israeli soldier held hostage by extremists. And they must enforce the law without corruption so they can earn the trust of their people and of the world. Taking these steps will enable the Palestinians to have a state of their own. And there's only one way to end the conflict. And nothing less is acceptable. Israel has a clear path. Prime Minister Olmert must continue to release Palestinian tax revenues to the government of Prime Minister Fayad. Prime Minister Olmert has also made clear that Israel's future lies in developing areas like the Nagaf (ph) in Galilee, not in continuing occupation of the West Bank. This is a reality that Prime Minister Sharon recognized, as well. So unauthorized outposts should be removed and settlement expansion ended. At the same time Israelis should find other practical ways to reduce their footprint without reducing their security so they can help President Abbas improve economic and humanitarian conditions. They should be confident that the United States will never abandon its commitment to the security of Israel as a Jewish state and homeland for the Jewish people. The international community must rise to the moment and provide decisive support to responsible Palestinian leaders working for peace. One forum to develop that support is the ad hoc liaison committee, a group chaired by Norway that includes the United States and Japan, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, and Arab states such as Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Jordan. Today I call for a session of this committee to gather soon so that the world can back its words in real support for the new Palestinian government. The world can do more to build the conditions for peace. So I will call together an international meeting this fall of representatives from nations that support two-state solution, reject violence, recognize Israel's right to exist, and commit to all previous agreements between the parties. The key participants in this meeting will be the Israelis, the Palestinians, and their neighbors in the region. Secretary Rice will chair the meeting. She and her counterparts will review the progress that's been made toward building Palestinian institutions. They will look for innovative and effective ways to support further reform. And they will provide diplomatic support for the parties in their bilateral discussions and negotiations so that we can move forward on a successful path to a Palestinian state. Arab states have a pivotal role to play, as well. They should show strong support for President Abbas's government and reject the violent extreme -- extremism of Hamas. They should use their resources to provide much needed assistance to the Palestinian people. Nations like Jordan and Egypt, which are natural gateways for Palestinian exports, should open up trade and create opportunities on both sides of the border. Arab nations should also take an active part in promoting peace negotiations. Relaunching the Arab League initiative was a welcome first step. Arab nations should build on this initiative, by ending the fiction that Israel does not exist, stopping the incitement of hatred in their official media, and sending cabinet level visitors to Israel. All these steps, today's Arab leaders can show themselves to be the equals of peacemakers like Anwar Sadat and King Hussein of Jordan. The conflict in Gaza and the West Bank today is the struggle between extremists and moderates. And these are not the only places where the forces of radicalism and violence threaten freedom and peace. Struggle between extremists and moderates is also playing out in Lebanon, where Hezbollah and Syria and Iran are trying to destabilize the popularly elected government. The struggle is playing out in Afghanistan, where the Taliban and al Qaeda are trying to roll back democratic gains. And the struggle is playing out in Iraq, where al Qaeda insurgents and militia are trying to defy the will of nearly 12 million Iraqis who voted for a free future. Ceding any of these struggles to extremists would have deadly consequences for the region in the world. So in Gaza and the West Bank and beyond, the international community must stand with the brave men and women who are working for peace. Recent days have brought a chapter of upheaval and uncertainty in the Middle East. But the story does not have to end that way. After the wave of killing by Hamas last month, a 16-year-old girl in Gaza City told a reporter, \"The gunmen want to destroy the culture of our fathers and grandfathers. We will not allow them to do it.\" She went on, \"I'm saying it's enough killing. Enough.\" That young woman speaks for millions in Gaza, the West Bank, in Israel, and Arab nations and in every nation. And now the world must answer her call. We must show that, in the face of extremism and violence, we stand on the side of tolerance and decency. In the face of chaos and murder, we stand on the side of law and justice. And in the face of terror and cynicism and anger, we stand on the side of peace in the holy land. Thank you.</s>PHILLIPS: The president of the United States there at the White House talking about propping up the Palestinian government, which of course, has been in turmoil since the breakdown of it.

    "document": "NNSA is responsible for managing national nuclear security missions: ensuring a safe, secure, and reliable nuclear deterrent; supplying nuclear fuel to the Navy; and supporting the nation\u2019s nuclear nonproliferation efforts. NNSA largely relies on management and operating contractors to carry out these missions and to manage the day-to-day operations at eight sites collectively known as NNSA\u2019s nuclear security enterprise. The Y-12 National Security Complex in Tennessee is the primary site among these with enriched uranium capabilities. Y-12\u2019s primary mission is processing and storing uranium, processing uranium for naval reactors for the Navy, and developing associated technologies, including technologies to produce uranium-related components for nuclear warheads and bombs. According to NNSA documents, Y-12\u2019s enriched uranium operations have key shortcomings, including an inefficient workflow, continually rising operations and maintenance costs stemming from facility age, and hazardous processes that could expose workers to radiological contamination. To address these shortcomings, NNSA developed plans to replace aging infrastructure at Y-12 and relocate key processing equipment without jeopardizing uranium production operations. In 2004, NNSA initially proposed relocating Y-12\u2019s main uranium processing equipment into a new facility referred to as the UPF. NNSA planned to construct this single, consolidated facility that would reduce the overall size of existing uranium processing facilities, reduce operating costs by using modern equipment, and increase worker and environmental health and safety. NNSA estimated in 2007 that the UPF would cost approximately $1.4 billion to $3.5 billion to design and construct. In June 2012, the Deputy Secretary of Energy approved an updated cost estimate range for the UPF of $4.2 billion to $6.5 billion, with the latter being the project\u2019s maximum allowable cost. However, by August 2012, the UPF contractor concluded that the UPF as designed would not provide enough space to house all of the uranium processing and other equipment. In October 2013, an external review estimated that the UPF project could cost as much as $11 billion. In 2014, because of the high cost and scheduling concerns of a solution focused solely on constructing new buildings, NNSA established its uranium program within its Office of Defense Programs. NNSA also prepared a high-level strategic plan based on its objectives of 1) completing the UPF project with a reduced scope within the cost and schedule limits established for the original UPF project and 2) phasing out mission dependency on Building 9212. Under NNSA\u2019s revised approach, the agency plans to transition production operations out of Building 9212 and into the re-scoped UPF or existing buildings at Y-12 after they have been upgraded as described in further detail below. Building 9212. Constructed in 1945, the building\u2019s design predates modern nuclear safety codes. It consists of a number of interconnected buildings that contain capabilities for uranium purification and casting, among other things. One of NNSA\u2019s key goals is to shut down the Building 9212 operations that have the highest nuclear safety risks. Because of these risks, NNSA is implementing a four-phase exit strategy to systematically phase out mission dependency on Building 9212. According to NNSA\u2019s September 2018 implementation plan for the exit strategy, the first three phases focus on reducing inventory, system isolation and clean out, and relocating capabilities from Building 9212 to other existing Y- 12 facilities or to the UPF once startup is complete. Building 9212 will then enter a phase of post-operational clean out, during which operations will be limited to simple processing, recovery, and inventory accountability. By about 2035, management of the building will transition to DOE\u2019s Office of Environmental Management for decontamination and decommissioning activities. Building 9215. Constructed in the 1950s, the building\u2019s design predates modern nuclear safety codes. It consists of three main structures, and its current primary function is fabrication, which involves metal machining operations for enriched uranium. As part of the Building 9212 exit strategy, NNSA plans to move capabilities into Building 9215, such as the uranium purification and the processing of uranium metal scraps resulting from machining operations. The uranium program is managing the development and deployment of new technologies to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of these capabilities. NNSA initially intended to house these two capabilities in the UPF before re-scoping the project to meet its cost and schedule goals. According to NNSA documents, NNSA is identifying and prioritizing infrastructure investments for Building 9215 that are to ensure its reliability through the 2040s. Building 9995. Constructed in the mid-1950s, this building\u2019s design predates modern nuclear safety codes. It consists of a laboratory with capabilities for analytical chemistry operations, which can sample enriched uranium for material assay, chemistry content, and metallography in support of production. NNSA initially intended to house the analytical chemistry capabilities to support enriched uranium processing and material characterization in the UPF before re-scoping the project to meet its cost and schedule goals. According to NNSA documents, NNSA is identifying and prioritizing infrastructure investments for Building 9995 that are to ensure its reliability through the 2040s and its continued analytical chemistry support for the UPF and Y-12 more broadly. Building 9204-2E. Constructed in the late 1960s, this building\u2019s design predates modern nuclear safety codes. It consists of a three- story, reinforced concrete frame structure that includes capabilities for assembly and disassembly of enriched uranium components with other materials. According to NNSA officials, the agency installed its radiography capability in Building 9204-2E in April 2017. According to NNSA documents, NNSA is identifying and prioritizing infrastructure investments for Building 9204-2E that are to ensure its reliability through the 2040s. Highly Enriched Uranium Materials Facility (HEUMF) (also called Building 9720-82). Beginning operations in January 2010, this building was built to modern nuclear safety codes. It is a reinforced concrete and steel structure that provides long-term storage of enriched uranium materials and accepts the transfer of some legacy enriched uranium from older facilities. HEUMF is the central repository for highly enriched uranium. Figure 1 shows NNSA\u2019s planned relocation of uranium processing capabilities out of Building 9212 and into the re-scoped UPF and existing Y-12 facilities. The figure also indicates which existing facilities will require infrastructure investments to support enriched uranium operations. Under the new approach, the re-scoped UPF will be smaller than the UPF project\u2019s original design and will house capabilities for casting, oxide production, and salvage and accountability of enriched uranium. NNSA has stated that the re-scoped UPF is to be built for no more than $6.5 billion by the end of 2025 through seven subprojects, described below. Site Readiness. This subproject included work to relocate an existing road, construct a new bridge, and extend an existing haul road. Site Infrastructure and Services. This subproject included demolition, excavation, and construction of a parking lot, security portal, concrete batch plant, and support building. Substation. This subproject included construction of an electrical power substation to provide power to the UPF and Y-12, replacing an existing substation at Y-12. Process Support Facilities. This subproject includes work to provide chilled water and storage of chemical and gas supplies for the UPF. Salvage and Accountability Building. This subproject includes construction of a nuclear facility for the decontamination of wastes and recovery of chemicals associated with uranium processing. Main Process Building. This subproject includes construction of the main nuclear facility to contain casting and special oxide production capabilities and a secure connecting portal to the HEUMF. Mechanical Electrical Building. This subproject includes construction of a building to house mechanical, electrical, heating, ventilation, air conditioning, and utility equipment for the Salvage and Accountability Building and Main Process Building. NNSA is required to manage construction of capital asset projects with a total project cost of greater than $50 million, such as the UPF, in accordance with DOE Order 413.3B. NNSA\u2019s Office of Acquisition and Project Management manages the UPF project under DOE Order 413.3B with funding from NNSA\u2019s Office of Defense Programs through the uranium program. DOE Order 413.3B requires that the project go through five management reviews and approvals, called \u201ccritical decisions\u201d (CD), as the project moves from planning and design to construction and operation. (See fig. 2.) DOE Order 413.3B also requires that, before project completion (CD-4), NNSA issue a transition-to- operations plan, which is to ensure efficient and effective management as a project becomes operational and provide a basis for attaining initial and full operational capability. For projects likely to have an extended period of transition to the start of operations, an August 2016 memorandum from DOE requires that NNSA develop a more detailed plan to attain full operational capability. The plan must be developed earlier in the project management process\u2014 before start of construction (CD-3). In addition, NNSA must provide quarterly updates to DOE\u2019s Project Management Risk Committee after completing construction until full operational capability is attained. The memorandum notes that DOE\u2019s complex nuclear facilities can have significant risks that continue after project completion. These ongoing risks may impact achievement of full operational capability and thus require more efficient management. In September 2019, we reported that DOE officials stated that the August 2016 memorandum was largely created in response to experience with the Integrated Waste Treatment Unit facility at Idaho National Laboratory. This facility, which is intended to treat two forms of nuclear waste, is not operating as expected approximately 7 years after the completion of its construction. DOE Order 413.3B also states that projects with a total estimated cost of more than $100 million should have an independent cost estimate and external independent review prior to approval of the project\u2019s performance baselines for cost and schedule (CD-2). Further, appropriations acts since fiscal year 2012 have included a limitation that prohibits the use of funds to approve CD-2 (approval of the project\u2019s performance baselines for cost and schedule) or CD-3 (approval to start construction) for capital asset projects where total project costs exceed $100 million until a separate independent cost estimate has been developed. According to DOE\u2019s standard operating procedure for conducting independent cost estimates, an independent cost estimate is prepared by an organization independent of the project sponsor\u2014DOE-PM, in this case\u2014using the same detailed technical and procurement information that was used to make the initial project estimate. The purpose of the estimate is to validate the project\u2019s performance baselines\u2014which include cost and schedule estimates\u2014to determine these estimates\u2019 accuracy and reasonableness. DOE-PM may use the independent cost estimate as supporting information in developing the external independent review. The external independent review is a broader analysis of the project to provide an unbiased assessment of whether NNSA can execute the project within the proposed scope, schedule, and cost commitments while meeting key performance requirements and fulfilling the mission need. Many of the federal government\u2019s more costly and complex capital asset projects, including the UPF, require the development of cutting-edge technologies and integration of those technologies into large and complex systems. For example, DOE and NNSA use a systematic approach for assessing how far a technology has matured to evaluate the technology\u2019s readiness to be integrated into a system\u2014Technology Readiness Levels (TRL). This approach is intended to ensure that new technologies are sufficiently mature in time to be used successfully when a project is completed. TRLs progress from the least mature level, in which the basic technology principles are observed (TRL-1), to the highest maturity level, in which the total system is used successfully in project operations (TRL- 9). DOE Order 413.3B requires that each critical technology item or system on which a project depends must be demonstrated as a prototype in an operational environment (TRL-7) before the project\u2019s performance baselines are approved (CD-2). According to our guide on evaluating technology readiness, assessing technology readiness does not eliminate the risk of relying on new technology but can identify concerns and serve as the basis for realistic discussions on how to mitigate potential risks associated with the project\u2019s scope, for example. According to the Project Management Institute, Inc. (PMI), effective program management, in addition to effective project management, is important to the success of efforts such as NNSA\u2019s uranium program. According to PMI\u2019s standard for program management, effective program management helps ensure that a group of related projects and program activities are managed in a coordinated way to obtain benefits not available from managing them individually. Program management involves aligning multiple components to achieve the program\u2019s goals. Other general standards relevant to program management for the uranium program include our cost-estimating guide and schedule assessment guide. In March 2009, we issued our cost-estimating guide to provide a consistent methodology that is based on cost-estimating best practices and that can be used across the federal government for developing, managing, and evaluating program cost estimates. The methodology outlined in the guide is a compilation of best practices that federal cost-estimating organizations and industry use to develop and maintain reliable cost estimates throughout the life of a government acquisition program. According to the guide, developing accurate life- cycle cost estimates has become a high priority for agencies in properly managing their portfolios of capital assets and in decision-making throughout the process. A life-cycle cost estimate provides an exhaustive and structured accounting of all resources and associated cost elements required to develop, produce, deploy, and sustain a particular program. The guide also states that a reliable cost estimate reflects all costs associated with a program\u2014meaning that the estimate must be based on a complete scope of work\u2014and the estimate should be updated to reflect changes in requirements (which may affect the scope of work). In December 2015, we issued our schedule guide, which develops the scheduling concepts introduced in our cost-estimating guide and presents them as best practices associated with developing and maintaining a reliable, high-quality schedule. According to the schedule guide, a well- planned schedule is a fundamental management tool that can help government programs use funds effectively by specifying when work will be performed and by measuring program performance against an approved plan. An integrated master schedule integrates all of the planned work in the program, the resources necessary to accomplish that work, and the associated budget, and it should be the focal point for program management. This schedule can show, for example, the completion dates for all activities leading up to major events or milestones, which can help determine if the program\u2019s parameters are realistic and achievable. An integrated master schedule may consist of several or several hundred individual project or other activity schedules that represent the various efforts within a program. It should include the entire known scope of work, including the effort necessary from all government, contractor, and other key parties for a program\u2019s successful execution. In addition, NNSA has various program management policies and guidance that apply to uranium program efforts that are not capital asset projects and that fall outside of DOE Order 413.3B. For example: NNSA issued a program management policy in January 2017 that defines general roles and responsibilities for the program managers for all of its strategic materials, such as uranium. This policy broadly outlines the managers\u2019 authority and responsibilities for managing the strategic materials; these responsibilities include developing program documentation and managing risk. NNSA issued a program management policy in February 2019 that states program managers should establish and document the requirements for scope, schedule, and cost management using a tailored approach to their program. These requirements include the development of schedule and cost estimates that cover the life cycle of a program where appropriate, among other things. NNSA\u2019s program guidance\u2014applicable to the uranium program and others that fall under the Office of Defense Programs\u2014recommends the development of an integrated master schedule and states that having one supports effective management of a program\u2019s scope, risk, and day-to-day activities. Specifically, the guidance states that during the initial phases of a program, an integrated master schedule provides an early understanding of the required scope of work, key events, accomplishment criteria, and the likely program structure by depicting the progression of work through the remaining phases. The guidance allows for tailoring of the agency\u2019s management approach based on the particular program being managed. According to NNSA documents and officials, the UPF project is on schedule and within budget, and NNSA has developed a plan to receive start-up authorization for UPF operations in 2025 and attain full operational capability in 2026. NNSA documents and officials reported that the UPF project is on track to meet its cost and schedule baseline estimates, and thus is expected to be constructed for $6.5 billion by the end of 2025. According to DOE\u2019s project report and NNSA officials, three of the seven UPF subprojects are complete and four are ongoing as of December 2019. When we last reported in September 2017, NNSA had completed the Site Readiness subproject. In February 2018, NNSA completed the Site Infrastructure and Services subproject\u2014about 2 months early and about $18 million under budget. In December 2019, NNSA completed the Substation subproject\u2014about 6 months early and $13 million under budget. As shown in table 1, by March 2018 all UPF subprojects\u2019 formal scopes of work and cost and schedule baseline estimates were approved (CD-2), and NNSA gained approval to start construction on them (CD-3). Since establishing these cost and schedule baseline estimates, NNSA officials stated that they have not made any significant changes that would require DOE executive-level approval. According to DOE policy, changes that affect the project\u2019s ability to satisfy the mission need or that increase costs by the lesser of $100 million or half the project costs must be approved by the DOE Deputy Secretary as DOE\u2019s Chief Executive for Project Management. According to DOE\u2019s project report and NNSA officials, the four ongoing subprojects were progressing on schedule and within budget as of December 2019. NNSA officials stated that they expect these subprojects to meet their respective cost and schedule performance baselines and that the overall UPF project will be constructed for $6.5 billion by the end of 2025. (See fig. 3 for photograph of Main Process Building and Salvage and Accountability Building\u2019s construction progress as of September 2019.) NNSA and its contractor for Y-12 have developed a plan to receive start- up authorization for UPF operations in 2025 and then will likely attain full operational capability for the UPF in 2026, according to NNSA officials and contractor representatives. DOE and NNSA approved this plan, which is required by DOE policy, in February 2018. This plan outlines three major risks associated with the UPF project that NNSA will need to address so that the project can attain full operational capability: 1. Capabilities and systems integration within the UPF. Addressing this risk includes actions to ensure that all of the UPF\u2019s systems, and the capabilities that those systems provide (e.g., casting, oxide production), can function together as designed through testing. 2. Process prove-in and design authority qualification. Addressing this risk includes actions to ensure that the UPF\u2019s systems meet certain metrics and are qualified for mission work. Aspects of this include laboratory analysis, statistical validation of repeatability, and engineering evaluations. 3. Integration of UPF with other facilities. Addressing this risk includes actions to ensure that the UPF systems can interface with other facilities\u2019 systems (e.g., those in Buildings 9215, 9204-2E, and 9995) as designed and that all systems are able to support full-scale operations. NNSA officials estimated that construction of the UPF will be completed in 2022. According to the plan, the UPF will then go through various preoperational testing and operational readiness reviews to demonstrate the capabilities using nonhazardous surrogate material. Following testing and readiness reviews, the UPF will gain startup authorization, go through additional testing and first use, and then attain full operational capability\u2014 also referred to as \u201coperational release.\u201d NNSA officials and contractor representatives stated in June 2019 that the UPF should receive startup authorization sometime in 2025, before the project\u2019s estimated completion (CD-4) date of December 2025. These officials and representatives estimated that the UPF would attain full operational capability about a year from receiving that startup authorization\u2014that is, sometime in 2026. (See fig. 4.) NNSA officials stated in October 2019 that in fiscal year 2020 they will update the plan to attain full operational capability to include a schedule with more specific time frames for startup authorization, hot functional testing, first use, and operational release, among other things. According to NNSA\u2019s plan, attaining full operational capability for the UPF is the final step that will ultimately lead to and enable the cessation of uranium operations in Building 9212, which could then be turned over to DOE Office of Environmental Management for final disposition in 2035. NNSA followed requirements to obtain independent cost estimates for the UPF (i.e., the four largest UPF subprojects) whose total estimated costs exceeded $100 million. NNSA then used those estimates to help negotiate with contractors and inform baseline estimates. NNSA obtained independent cost estimates from DOE-PM for the four UPF subprojects for which total costs exceeded $100 million. As noted above, projects with total costs that exceed $100 million are subject to an appropriations limitation unless independent cost estimates are obtained, and DOE policy requires such estimates for such projects. DOE-PM, an office independent from NNSA and its management of the UPF project, conducted the independent cost estimates for the four larger subprojects: the Mechanical Electrical Building, Process Support Facilities, Salvage and Accountability Building, and Main Process Building subprojects. In addition, NNSA officials stated that they obtained independent reviews for the three subprojects for which costs did not exceed $100 million. DOE policy does not require independent cost estimates for projects whose total estimated costs are less than the $100 million threshold. However, a NNSA policy states that NNSA should obtain an independent cost estimate or independent cost review to validate a project\u2019s cost baselines for those projects for which estimated costs are between $20 million and $100 million. NNSA organized the independent cost estimates for the four larger subprojects so that some of the independent cost estimates included work for more than one subproject. Specifically, DOE-PM completed two estimates\u2014one in March 2016 and one in December 2016\u2014that included site preparation work and long lead procurements for the Salvage and Accountability Building and Main Process Building subprojects. In November 2016, DOE-PM completed the independent cost estimate for the Mechanical Electrical Building, which was the only estimate to include a single UPF subproject. NNSA officials explained that they handled the estimate for this subproject differently because work for the Mechanical Electrical Building could be separated easily from the other subprojects, and it was largely designed as a commercial-grade building. Lastly, in November 2017, DOE-PM completed the independent cost estimate for the majority of the work for the Process Support Facilities, Salvage and Accountability Building, and Main Process Building subprojects. NNSA officials stated they organized the independent cost estimates in this way to meet DOE requirements and appropriations limitations but still be able to begin work on the aspects of the overall UPF project that need to be completed earliest. DOE-PM conducted the four UPF subprojects\u2019 independent cost and schedule estimates using our cost estimating and scheduling best practices, according to DOE-PM\u2019s independent cost estimate reports. DOE-PM reviewed the project\u2019s key cost drivers\u2014elements whose sensitivity significantly affects the total project cost. The DOE-PM team then established independent estimates for those cost drivers, which may include vendor quotes for major equipment and detailed estimates for other materials, labor, and subcontracts. The team also prepared an independently generated resource-loaded schedule that allowed them to check for adequate funding compared with the project\u2019s funding profile developed by the project team. DOE-PM\u2019s analyses are based on their review of the UPF project\u2019s work breakdown structure and associated documents, which include all of the activities that make up the project\u2019s scope. DOE-PM also compared the UPF project estimates with our cost estimating and scheduling best practices, according to DOE-PM\u2019s independent cost estimate reports. For example, DOE-PM\u2019s November 2017 report found that the three larger UPF subproject\u2019s cost and schedule estimates partially met the best practices and recommended some changes to the contractor to address those estimates that did not. DOE-PM reconciled the results of its independent cost estimates with the initial project estimates, as required by DOE\u2019s standard operating procedure and NNSA\u2019s business operating procedure for conducting independent cost estimates. During the reconciliation, DOE-PM worked with the UPF project team to adjust both the initial project estimates and its own independent cost estimates to correct any errors or misinterpretations of project requirements, according to the independent cost estimate reports. Under DOE\u2019s and NNSA\u2019s independent cost estimate procedures and according to DOE-PM officials, any remaining differences should be identified and explained, but estimates should not be changed. DOE-PM drew from the independent cost estimates for the Mechanical Electrical Building subproject to complete an external independent review of that subproject in November 2016. Then, DOE-PM drew from the independent cost estimates that included work for the Main Process Building, Salvage and Accountability Building, and Process Support Facilities subprojects to complete its external independent review of the UPF project in March 2018. NNSA officials stated that they used information from DOE-PM\u2019s independent cost estimate and external independent review reports to help negotiate remaining work with the contractor and finalize the overall UPF project\u2019s baseline estimates before starting construction. In June 2018, NNSA prepared a strategy to guide its negotiation of the remaining UPF project work that had not yet been priced with the contractor. Based on our review of NNSA\u2019s negotiation strategy, we found that NNSA used DOE-PM\u2019s independent cost estimate and external independent review reports to negotiate at least 14 of the 22 major and minor issues identified for discussion. These 14 issues included, for example, reducing concrete and freight direct costs, reducing the margin added to cover any increase in design scope, reducing subcontractor indirect costs, and increasing accuracy of other cost and schedule estimates. DOE approved NNSA\u2019s cost and schedule baseline estimates (CD-2) and start of construction (CD-3) in March 2018 for three UPF subprojects. (See table 2 for the recommended cost and schedule baselines from the external independent review report and the final cost and schedule baseline estimates for all UPF subprojects.) In five of the seven subprojects, the final cost baseline estimates were close to or below the recommended baselines from DOE-PM\u2019s external independent review. Also, in four of the seven subprojects, the final schedule baseline estimates were close to the recommended baselines. According to NNSA officials, the UPF project final baseline cost estimate includes cost contingency, and the December 2025 final schedule baseline estimate includes a year of schedule contingency. NNSA officials stated that, if necessary, they could use available funds to expedite the schedule. NNSA officials also expressed confidence that the UPF project will meet its goal of construction for $6.5 billion by the end of 2025. Since we last reported in September 2017, NNSA identified and made progress in implementing the uranium program\u2019s scope of work and developed an integrated master schedule and life-cycle cost estimate\u2014 key management information for the program. The uranium program\u2019s integrated master schedule extends through fiscal year 2035, and the life- cycle cost estimate includes the $7.4 billion in program costs from fiscal years 2016 through 2026. Since we last reported in September 2017, NNSA identified the uranium program\u2019s scope of work and made progress in carrying out key activities. Specifically, NNSA identified the uranium program\u2019s scope of work as required under NNSA program management policy and which we identified as a leading practice in our cost estimating and schedule guides. According to NNSA documents we reviewed and officials we interviewed, NNSA developed the uranium program\u2019s scope of work in a work breakdown structure, which defines in detail the work or activities necessary to accomplish the program\u2019s objectives. NNSA officials stated that the uranium program\u2019s scope of work includes the UPF project as well as the capabilities and other activities necessary for the overall modernization effort that are not part of the UPF project. NNSA made progress implementing the following three main areas of the uranium program\u2019s scope of work: Process Technology Development. Since we last reported in September 2017, NNSA\u2019s uranium program has made progress in three of the four process technology projects that it manages to develop new uranium processing capabilities. According to NNSA officials, these capabilities are not included in the UPF project but are necessary to complete the suite of uranium capabilities required to meet weapons program needs. NNSA approved the electrorefining project\u2019s cost and schedule performance baselines and start of construction (CD-2/3) in February 2019. This project, along with the direct chip melt projects discussed further below, are designed to provide a capability that was scoped out of the UPF project. Specifically, the electrorefining project is to provide the capability to purify uranium metal. NNSA officials stated that the calciner project will have its cost and schedule baselines and start of construction approved (CD- 2/3) in May 2020. This project is to provide the capability to convert uranium-bearing solutions to uranium oxide (a dry solid) so that it can be stored pending further processing in the future. The project will be located in Building 9212 and supports the exit of that building by enabling the processing of certain uranium- bearing solutions (such as the solutions resulting from cleaning out the building\u2019s pipes and vessels) into a dry solid oxide that can be stored pending further processing. According to NNSA officials, the direct chip melt projects include two related efforts\u2014a front-loading furnace and a bottom- loading furnace\u2014that will provide the capability to process uranium scrap metal. Officials stated that the front-loading furnace direct chip melt project received approval to start work in September 2019 and has an estimated project completion of May 2021. This will provide near-term capability to process uranium scrap metal until the bottom-loading furnaces are designed and constructed. Officials said NNSA initiated the bottom-loading furnace direct chip melt project in July 2019 and expects to start construction in January 2021. Because the direct chip melt projects fall below the $50 million threshold for management under DOE Order 413.3B, they do not have CD dates. However, NNSA officials stated they will manage and oversee the bottom- loading furnace project under the Office of Defense Programs\u2019 authorization-to-proceed memorandum and follow the sound project management principles outlined in the order. NNSA officials stated that the agency requires an oxide-to-metal conversion capability. In June 2019, NNSA issued a Notice of Intent to enter into a sole-source contract to provide the uranium oxide to metal conversion capability. According to NNSA officials, this potential sole-source contract is a near-term strategy that could cover any gap caused by phasing out operations in Building 9212. According to NNSA, under this contract the contractor could provide conversion services in 2023, effectively covering any gap caused by phasing out conversion operations in Building 9212. NNSA officials stated that the agency intends to continue pursuing the direct electrolytic reduction technology to provide the oxide-to-metal conversion capability after the sole-source contract, but the technology has not progressed since we last reported in 2017. Extended Life Programs. In December 2017, NNSA developed the implementation plan for the extended life programs for Buildings 9215 and 9204-2E. NNSA also developed an extended life program for Building 9995 in November 2017 and the implementation plan for that program in September 2018. NNSA updated both of these implementation plans in September 2019. Further, in September 2018, NNSA developed an implementation plan for its strategy to stop operations in Building 9212 and begin post-operations clean-out activities. These implementation plans identify a specific scope of work, and the necessary funding, that NNSA must execute in order to extend the operational lives of Buildings 9215, 9204-2E, and 9995 through the 2040s. Reducing Material at Risk in Older Buildings. Since we last reported in September 2017, NNSA has made progress in its efforts to move uranium materials out of older facilities and into the HEUMF. Specifically, NNSA officials said in November 2019 that they were about 77 percent done with this effort and had moved more than 50 metric tons of uranium out of older facilities and into the HEUMF since fiscal year 2015. In June 2019, NNSA officials said that their current strategy focuses on incorporating near-just-in-time inventory practices and further reducing material at risk by 2023. According to NNSA officials, this strategy is to further minimize the amount of material that is staged in Y-12\u2019s older buildings. Also, according to NNSA officials, NNSA achieved a target working inventory of material in Building 9215 in 2016 and in Building 9204-2E in 2019. NNSA officials stated that, as of November 2019, they were on schedule to complete the remaining efforts by their estimated time frames. NNSA officials stated that the program\u2019s scope of work includes elements for which additional analyses may be required and that any additional program work identified by those analyses will be incorporated into the scope of work, as appropriate. For example, NNSA identified the additional environmental and seismic analyses necessary to develop the scope of work for addressing certain structural deficiencies in Buildings 9215 and 9204-2E. NNSA is under a court order to complete additional environmental and seismic risk analyses following a 2014 update in the seismic hazard map for the area, which showed a greater risk than the previous version. According to Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board officials, in response to its 2015 report, NNSA identified their approach for re-evaluating the facilities\u2019 conditions and risks and addressing some of the board\u2019s seismic-related concerns. According to board officials, NNSA plans to start the re-evaluation of these structures in early fiscal year 2020. NNSA officials stated that if the additional analyses identify additional necessary work for the uranium program, NNSA will update the scope of work and revise the extended life program implementation plans to include that work. In December 2019, NNSA developed an integrated master schedule through fiscal year 2035 and a life-cycle cost estimate for the program through fiscal year 2026 that includes over $850 million in costs in addition to the UPF project. Successful management of federal acquisition programs, such as NNSA\u2019s uranium program, partly depends on developing this key management information, as stated in our cost estimating and schedule guides. In September 2017, we found that NNSA had not yet developed an integrated master schedule or life-cycle cost estimate for the uranium program and recommended that NNSA set a time frame for doing so. NNSA agreed with this recommendation and has made progress in implementing it. A complete scope of work is required to develop an integrated master schedule and life-cycle cost estimate. (See fig. 5.) In December 2019, NNSA developed an integrated master schedule based on the uranium program\u2019s scope of work to help manage its uranium program, as recommended in NNSA\u2019s program guidance as well as our schedule guide and other best practices. According to PMI\u2019s Program Management Standard, a program-integrated master schedule is the top-level planning document that includes individual program elements\u2019 schedules and defines their dependencies among those required to achieve the program\u2019s goals. According to NNSA officials, NNSA included all of the uranium program\u2019s capabilities and elements that make up its scope of work, as well as other work that may affect the program, through fiscal year 2035. NNSA officials stated that the schedule includes the key milestones for each uranium program capability and element, such as project completion (CD-4) and operational release, since these key milestones are important for tracking the uranium program\u2019s critical path of activities and for overall program management. NNSA officials stated that they will start reporting the uranium program\u2019s progress against this integrated master schedule beginning in 2020. NNSA officials stated that they expect the integrated master schedule to be iterative and that they will update it to capture any changes or additions to the program\u2019s scope of work. In December 2019, NNSA developed a life-cycle cost estimate through fiscal year 2026 for the uranium program, as called for in our cost estimating guide and other best practices. NNSA estimated that the uranium program will spend a total of approximately $7.4 billion from fiscal years 2016 through 2026 to support its uranium processing modernization efforts. Specifically, NNSA officials stated that the life-cycle cost estimate includes $6.5 billion in UPF project costs and over $850 million in program costs that include developing the uranium processing capabilities that are not part of the UPF project, integrating those capabilities with the UPF, improving the infrastructure of existing buildings, and transitioning out of Building 9212. NNSA officials stated that they estimated uranium program life-cycle costs from fiscal years 2016 through 2026 because they could not accurately estimate some of the activities in the program\u2019s scope of work that are enduring for the nuclear security enterprise rather than specific projects with finite schedules for construction. According to our cost- estimating guide, a reliable cost estimate reflects all costs associated with a program\u2019s scope of work, and the estimate should be updated to reflect any changes in requirements\u2014that is, a life-cycle cost estimate can be iterative. NNSA officials stated that they expect to update the life-cycle cost estimate with additional program costs, once known, and will include any additional future scope added to the program. Schedule milestones and cost estimates included in NNSA\u2019s integrated master schedule and life-cycle cost estimate for the uranium program are summarized in table 3. We are encouraged that NNSA may be able to better manage the day-to- day activities of the uranium program and mitigate any risks associated with integrating the UPF project with other aspects of the program through its development of key program management information\u2014a scope of work, an integrated master schedule, and a life-cycle cost estimate. Successful program management through the life of a program depends in part on all of these efforts and may provide decision makers such as Congress with needed information on the program\u2019s complete scope of work, key events, and expected long-term program costs. We provided DOE and NNSA with a draft of this report for review and comment. NNSA provided technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate. We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional committees, the Secretary of Energy, the Administrator of the National Nuclear Security Administration, and other interested parties.

    "human_reference": "A supply of enriched uranium is crucial to support the nation's nuclear weapons stockpile and the U.S. Navy, but the infrastructure of several U.S. uranium-processing facilities is outdated. In 2014, NNSA began plans to meet the nation's uranium needs by redirecting processing capabilities to the UPF and to other existing buildings NNSA plans to upgrade at Y-12 in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013, as amended, includes a provision for GAO to periodically review the UPF. Also, a Senate report accompanying the National Defense Authorization Act bill for fiscal year 2012 provides for GAO to review the independent cost estimates for the UPF. This report, which is GAO's sixth on the UPF, examines (1) the status of the UPF project and plans for starting UPF operations; (2) the extent to which NNSA has followed requirements to obtain independent cost estimates for the UPF, and how NNSA has used information from those estimates; and (3) the extent to which NNSA has made progress in developing uranium program management information since GAO's September 2017 report. GAO reviewed project and program documents on planning, schedule, cost, and implementation, and interviewed program officials. National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) documents and officials reported that the new Uranium Processing Facility (UPF) is on schedule and within budget. As of December 2019, three of the seven UPF subprojects were complete, and four were ongoing. NNSA officials told GAO they estimate that construction of the UPF will be complete in 2022 and that they expect to meet NNSA's goal of completing the UPF project for $6.5 billion by the end of 2025. As required, NNSA and its contractor developed a plan for starting operations at the UPF, which officials stated will likely occur in 2026. According to NNSA's plan, attaining full UPF operational capability will be the final step to enable NNSA to stop certain operations in Building 9212\u2014the oldest building with the highest nuclear safety risk at the Y-12 National Security Complex (Y-12)\u2014and turn it over to the Department of Energy (DOE) for final disposition by 2035. In managing the UPF project, NNSA obtained independent cost estimates for the four largest UPF subprojects whose total estimated costs exceeded $100 million. Such estimates are required by DOE policy and to satisfy limitations in appropriations laws. Moreover, based on its review of NNSA documents, GAO found NNSA used those estimates to help inform the UPF's approved cost and schedule baseline estimates. NNSA officials stated that they used information from the independent cost estimate and other sources to help negotiate remaining work with the contractor and finalize the overall UPF's baseline estimates before starting construction. Since GAO last reported on NNSA's broader uranium program in September 2017, NNSA identified and made progress in implementing the uranium program's scope of work that includes capabilities and other activities that are not part of the UPF project but are needed for weapons program. Specifically, NNSA made progress in the following areas: 1. developing process technologies that are expected to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of certain uranium processing capabilities; 2. investing in infrastructure to extend the operational lives of older uranium facilities; and 3. reducing the amount of uranium stored and used in these older uranium facilities. NNSA has also made progress in implementing GAO's 2017 recommendation to develop key management information for the uranium program. Specifically, NNSA developed an integrated master schedule covering the scope of work for the program through fiscal year 2035 and a life-cycle cost estimate that includes program costs through fiscal year 2026. NNSA estimated that, in addition to completing the UPF project for $6.5 billion, the uranium program will spend over $850 million from fiscal years 2016 through 2026 to support modernizing other needed uranium processing capabilities and transitioning out of Building 9212.",

A current Reddit thread is testing its users resolve to do just this by placing a clickable button next to a 60-second timer. When The Button is clicked, the timer resets and it is not yet known what happens when the clock reaches zero because no-one can resist clicking it. More than 730,285 Reddit users have pressed The Button (pictured) since the California firm launched its r/thebutton thread on April Fool's Day. It is not yet known what happens when the timer reaches zero and users can only click The Button once . At the time of writing, more than 730,285 Reddit users have pressed The Button since Reddit launched its r/thebutton thread on April Fool's Day. Only people who registered on the site before this date are eligible to click The Button, and when they do they are awarded a colour, known as a 'flair.' This colour represents the time period at which they clicked The Button, ranging from zero to 60 seconds. According to the Flair Guide, users get a purple flair when they press The Button between 52 and 60 seconds. Blue flairs are awarded between 42 and 51 seconds, green flairs are between 32 and 41 seconds, yellow flairs are awarded when The Button is pressed when the timer is between 22 and 31 seconds, and orange flairs are between 12 and 21 seconds. Only people who registered on the site before this date are eligible to click The Button (picutrred left with the timer pictured centre and right), and when they do they are awarded a colour, known as a 'flair.' \u00a0This colour represents the time period at which they clicked The Button, ranging from zero up to 60 seconds . Users get a purple flair when they press The Button between 52 and 60 seconds, blue flairs are awarded between 42 and 51 seconds, green flairs are between 32 and 41 seconds, yellow flairs are awarded between 22 and 31 seconds, orange flairs are between 12 and 21 seconds, and red is between zero and 11 seconds . The last colour is red and this is only awarded to those who can resist clicking The Button until the timer reads between zero and 11 seconds. However, thousands of users at any one time are watching The Button - 2,665 at the time of writing - and if any of them click The Button, the timer resets. Users who registered before 1 April but have not yet pressed The Button will have a grey dot beneath their username. This guide shows what the colour-coded dots, known as 'flairs', correspond to on a person's account.\u00a0The numbered flair is rounded up from the time the user pressed The Button. For example, if they pressed it at 45.01 seconds, they will received a 46 second flair . Reddit launched its r/thebutton thread on April Fool's Day. If you created your Reddit account before 1 April 2015, you have one chance to press The Button. If you press it, the timer resets to 60 seconds. You can't see The Button on mobile Reddit apps. To press The Button, you must unlock it by clicking the lock hovering over the button. Once the lock is clicked it will expose The Button. You do not receive flair unless you post a comment or thread, or press The Button. If you comment or post a thread without pressing The Button, you will get a grey flair which says 'non-presser' when you hover over the colour. If you press The Button, nothing happens other than receiving a coloured flair with a number. The number and coloured flair you receive depends on how many seconds were left on the timer at the moment you pressed The Button. The numbered flair you receive is rounded up from the number you pressed The Button at. For example, if you pressed The Button at 45.01 seconds, you will get a 46 second flair.

    "document": "HOLMES: Welcome back to the program. We have just, of course, been discussing race in America. Well, South Africa has a history of racial struggle, but the company also carries another very heavy burden, an HIV epidemic, bigger than anywhere else in the world. Around 7 million people there are living with the virus. Oscar-winning actress Charlize Theron, who's from South Africa, has set up a charity aimed at bringing that number down. She joined me from Johannesburg to talk about her work.</s>HOLMES: Charlize Theron, thanks so much for your time. Great to have you on the program. Let's start with why South Africa, your home country, is a country so heavily burdened by the AIDS epidemic in this day and age.</s>THERON: Well, South Africa has been the hardest hit by this epidemic and still is. And it's just really unfortunate because HIV is 100 percent preventable. And being South African, I just couldn't see myself not doing something. I think once I left South Africa and came back and started really, as a young adult, paying attention to statistics and seeing the kind of unnecessary suffering that was happening here, there was - I had to do something about it. And so, it was really just a question of how can I be the most effective in helping to stop this epidemic.</s>HOLMES: What sort of damage is being done to African society? I know you've spoken before of so many children who lost parents and it was something that you grew up with and were very well aware of, growing up in South Africa, right?</s>THERON: Yes. I don't think there is a child of my generation that didn't grow up in hushed silences and their parents or adults always whispering about this monster that nobody really knew anything about and people were dying at a degree that was really frightening. And I think it definitely marked me as a child. Also, just kind of the misconceptions about what AIDS was at that time. And seeing a photo of Princess Di visiting a hospital with HIV-positive patients really moved me. We have come a long way. It's been - we have the largest treatment program in the world right now, but we still have 53 percent of our HIV infected people not - HIV-infected people not on treatment. So, we still have a long way to go. And I think for me and where my focus really stands with CTAOP is in really focusing on the adolescence of this country, the young people of this country who will be the future of this country, and not treating them to kind of curb AIDS, but to invest in them and invest in their youth and their health to be the future leaders, not just of South Africa, but of this world. I'm trying to get people not positive, so they don't need treatment.</s>HOLMES: Right.</s>THERON: That's my hope and my dream.</s>HOLMES: Where is the shortfall? Where is the government responsibility? Why are there places in countries like South Africa where that isn't available? Why on earth is it not available?</s>THERON: Look, the country - South Africa as a country and as a government has really stepped up to the play. And it took a long time for them to get there, but they really are a country that is taking this very seriously. But when you look at our economic structure and where we are with our economy, we're not a country that can be solely responsible for the burden of what this cost is. We need a bit of a bigger push here. There is a huge misconception. I think a lot of Americans think 25 percent of the budget is sent to South Africa or to AIDS aid. And that is not true. It's less than 1 percent and now it will be less than that since President Trump's administration made these cuts to that part. And so, I think as an international world, we have to look at how do we stop something that's a virus that could come back in several years or maybe tomorrow and cause a lot more damage than what it did in the last 30 years by getting 76 million people infected and having 35 million people die. That's something that might be a South African problem right now, but could very much be an international problem. So, why not solve it here, which is to end this.</s>HOLMES: Well thought. And I was going to ask you about President Trump and the cutbacks to overseas health projects and the impact of that. And you did address that. It just brought me to another thought, though, at the International AIDS Conference last year, you said we value some lives more than others. That's still the case in your view?</s>THERON: Well, when you look at the amount of people that are infected and how the AIDS epidemic has ravaged sub-Saharan Africa over the last decade versus what's been happening in the Western world, how can you deny that?</s>HOLMES: Right.</s>THERON: I think that some lives are valued more than others and I think that goes beyond the AIDS epidemic. I'm seeing it right now in America. So, I think that we have to look at that as a global front. We have to be brave enough to kind of look at that as part of the problem that's been keeping the AIDS epidemic alive for so long.</s>HOLMES: When you say you're seeing that in the US now, you mean with the current environment, what we've seen in Charlottesville and those issues sort of having a broader context. THERONL Yes. I see racism alive and well and that scares me and saddens me.</s>HOLMES: Thank you so much, Charlize Theron.</s>THERON: Thank you so much for having me.</s>HOLMES: And from a South African star to an icon, a quote by Nelson Mandela is the talk of Twitter, after this tweet by former President Barack Obama featuring the words of Mandela became the most liked tweet of all time. When we come back, imagining America at its peak, the hope and joie de vivre of new Americans who became citizens at the top of Freedom Tower. We will be right back with that.",

    "document": "Since 2008, both the number of pedestrian fatalities and the share of pedestrian fatalities as a percentage of overall highway fatalities have increased (see fig. 1). In 2008, pedestrian fatalities represented about 12 percent of overall highway fatalities, while in 2018 they represented about 17 percent. In addition to fatalities, the estimated number of pedestrians injured in crashes has increased from about 71,000 in 2008 to about 79,800 in 2018. A range of factors can influence pedestrian fatalities including exposure of pedestrians to crashes, roadway characteristics, and driver and pedestrian behavior. According to DOT officials, there is little nationwide information about pedestrian exposure to potential crashes and that data may be more available on the state or local level. Some national data, however, shows that there may have been some change in people walking. For example, the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s American Community Survey estimated that in 2018, 4 million people reported walking to work compared with an estimated 3.8 million people in 2010. Regarding roadways, in 2018 the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) reported that most pedestrian fatalities occur in urban areas on principal arterial roads that carry high volumes of traffic, traveling at the highest speeds. In 2015, we noted that behavior such as distracted driving, walking, and cycling may contribute to pedestrian and cyclist fatalities. When drivers and pedestrians use cell phones or are otherwise distracted, they may be less aware of their surroundings and more likely to be involved in a crash. Finally, NHTSA data shows that most pedestrian fatalities occurred after dark and at places other than intersections. Specifically, in 2018, of the 6,300 reported fatalities, over 4,700 pedestrians (about 75 percent) were killed after dark and about 4,600 pedestrians (about 73 percent) were killed at non-intersection locations. See appendix II for additional information on pedestrian fatalities from 2008 through 2018. Automakers have developed vehicle features intended to avoid pedestrian crashes and mitigate the extent of injury to pedestrians. Crash avoidance features (also known as \u201cactive\u201d safety features) rely on cameras, radar, and other devices to detect a pedestrian and then act to alert a driver to take action, or automatically apply a vehicle\u2019s brakes to slow or stop the vehicle to avoid striking a pedestrian (see fig. 2). One pedestrian crash avoidance system is referred to as pedestrian automatic emergency braking, which uses a camera, radar, or a combination, to automatically apply brakes to avoid a collision. Crash mitigation features (also known as \u201cpassive\u201d safety features) generally involve the use of pedestrian-friendly vehicle components that are designed to reduce the severity of injuries should a pedestrian be hit. Passive safety features can include energy absorbing bumper material, hoods that provide space between the hood and the hard components in the engine compartment, and contoured vehicle front-ends intended to reduce harm to pedestrians (see fig. 3). In executing its mission, NHTSA administers NCAP and issues federal motor vehicle safety standards (FMVSS) and the federal bumper standard, among other things. In general, NCAP tests supplement safety standards established in law or regulation. NCAP. Created in 1978, this program tests new vehicles to determine how well they protect drivers and passengers during a crash (front and side) and how well vehicles resist rollovers. NHTSA tests and rates vehicles using a five-star safety rating system with five stars being the highest safety rating and one star the lowest. NHTSA communicates the results of its vehicle tests through window labels on new vehicles and on its website. In 2010, NHTSA also began recommending various safety technologies for consumers to consider when purchasing vehicles. Recommended technologies include such things as forward collision warning (an alert that warns drivers to brake or steer to avoid a crash if they are too close to a car in front of them); lane departure warning (an alert that warns drivers of unintentional lane shifts); and automatic emergency braking, which can automatically activate a vehicle\u2019s brakes if a driver takes no action to avoid an imminent crash with a preceding vehicle. NHTSA has not yet included pedestrian automatic emergency braking systems as recommended technologies. Recommended technologies are not included in star ratings, but rather are features NHTSA believes consumers may wish to look for in new vehicles. Pedestrian safety tests are not currently part of NCAP. FMVSS. These are minimum performance standards established in regulation for new motor vehicles and items of motor vehicle equipment. According to NHTSA officials, FMVSS have test procedures and performance criteria with minimum thresholds for motor vehicles and motor vehicle equipment, such as minimum light intensity requirements for headlamps. Bumper standard. In addition, while not in the FMVSS, NHTSA\u2019s bumper standard prescribes performance requirements in regulation for passenger cars in low-speed front-end and rear collisions. According to NHTSA officials, the bumper standard is intended to prevent damage to the car body and safety related equipment at speeds equivalent to a 5 miles-per-hour (mph) crash into a parked vehicle of the same weight. The standard applies to front and rear bumpers on passenger cars, but not to other multipurpose passenger vehicles, such as SUVs, minivans, or pickup trucks. The United States is also involved with pedestrian safety internationally. In June 1998, the United States signed an international agreement administered by the United Nations concerning the establishment of global technical regulations for motor and other wheeled vehicles. The purpose of the agreement was to establish a global process for jointly developing technical regulations regarding such things as safety, environmental protection, and energy efficiency of vehicles. As part of this agreement, in 2008, Global Technical Regulation No. 9 was established to improve pedestrian safety by requiring vehicle hoods and bumpers to absorb energy more efficiently when impacted in a vehicle-to-pedestrian collision. This international standard has two sets of performance criteria: head impact requirements that ensure vehicle hoods provide protection to a pedestrian\u2019s head when impacted; and leg protection requirements for the front bumper that would require bumpers to subject pedestrians to lower impact forces. According to NHTSA, as a signatory to the 1998 agreement, the United States is obligated to consider adopting global technical regulations, but is not obligated to adopt them. NHTSA officials told us the agency has not yet initiated the rulemaking process for Global Technical Regulation No. 9. Although pedestrian safety testing is not currently a part of the U.S. NCAP, it is a part of similarly established new car assessment programs in other countries. For example, since 2016 both the European New Car Assessment Programme (Euro NCAP) and a program in Japan (known as the Japan New Car Assessment Program (JNCAP)) have tested vehicle pedestrian crash avoidance systems using a variety of scenarios and vehicle speeds. Euro NCAP tests include an adult dummy walking or running perpendicular to a test vehicle and walking parallel to a vehicle. Tests are also conducted with a child dummy running out from parked cars (see fig. 4). Euro NCAP tests are also conducted in daylight and at night. In the United States, two nongovernmental organizations have also conducted pedestrian safety testing. IIHS began a program to test pedestrian crash avoidance systems on 2018 and 2019 vehicles, and in 2020 began using the results to help determine its Top Safety Pick awards. The American Automobile Association (AAA) also recently conducted tests of crash avoidance systems. Moreover, crash mitigation tests that measure the potential for head and leg injuries resulting from pedestrian-motor vehicle crashes have been in place for many years in Europe and Japan. Euro NCAP began head and leg testing in 1997 and Japan began pedestrian head protection testing in 2003 and pedestrian leg protection testing in 2011. In general, these tests launch projectiles designed to simulate a person\u2019s legs or head into various locations on a vehicle\u2019s hood and bumper to assess the effectiveness in limiting pedestrian injury (see fig. 5). We found that several vehicle characteristics including the age and body type of the vehicle and the speed at which the vehicle was being driven at the time of the crash are associated with the increase in pedestrian fatalities from 2008 through 2018. However, NHTSA lacks complete data on the relationship between vehicle characteristics and pedestrian injuries, including detailed information on injury type and severity. Although NHTSA initiated a pilot program to improve its data collection protocol for pedestrian injuries, NHTSA lacks a plan for this program to evaluate its results and determine whether and how it should be expanded. Through FARS, NHTSA annually collects and analyzes data on all crashes involving pedestrian fatalities, including vehicle-related characteristics. Based on these data and relevant research, we analyzed the relationship between pedestrian fatalities and the age, body type, and speed of vehicles. Our analysis of FARS data shows that from 2008 through 2018, the number of pedestrian fatalities increased more for crashes involving vehicles that were: 11 years old or older (123 percent increase) compared with newer vehicles (9 percent increase); SUVs (68 percent increase) compared with other light trucks (25 percent increase), and passenger cars (47 percent increase); and traveling at reported speeds 31 mph and above (45 percent increase), compared to vehicles traveling at lower speeds (28 percent increase). The number of pedestrians struck and killed by vehicles 11 years old or older (older vehicles) increased more relative to the number of pedestrians struck and killed by vehicles 10 years old or newer (newer vehicles). In 2008, 1,139 pedestrian fatalities involved older vehicles, which represented about a quarter (26 percent) of reported pedestrian fatalities (see fig. 6). By 2018, that number more than doubled to 2,537 pedestrian fatalities, or 40 percent of reported pedestrian fatalities. Over that same time period, the number of pedestrian fatalities involving newer vehicles also increased from 2,800 in 2008 to 3,044 in 2018. However, this increase was less than fatalities involving older vehicles, and the overall share of pedestrian fatalities involving newer vehicles decreased from 63 to 48 percent over that period. The rise in the number of older vehicles involved in pedestrian fatalities may reflect the rise in the average age of vehicles in operation. According to data from DOT\u2019s Bureau of Transportation Statistics, the average age of all vehicles in operation in the United States increased by about 1.5 years from 10.1 years old in 2008 to 11.7 years old in 2018. In comparison, the average age of passenger vehicles that struck and killed pedestrians increased by roughly 2 years from 8.1 years in 2008 to 10 years in 2018. Another possible contributing factor to the increased share of pedestrian fatalities resulting from crashes with older vehicles may be the prevalence of safety features in newer vehicles compared with older vehicles. As discussed below, vehicle manufacturers are offering new vehicles with pedestrian safety features such as pedestrian crash avoidance and crash mitigation systems, which may reduce pedestrian injuries and fatalities. The number of pedestrian fatalities where passenger cars, SUVs, or other light trucks were reported as striking vehicles all increased from 2008 to 2018 (see table 1). However, the number of SUVs involved in fatal pedestrian crashes increased by a higher percentage than passenger cars and other light trucks. As table 1 shows, pedestrian fatalities involving SUVs increased by about 68 percent, while pedestrian fatalities involving passenger cars increased by 47 percent and light trucks and vans increased by 25 percent. Additionally, although the number of SUVs involved in pedestrian fatalities increased the most in this timeframe, passenger cars still accounted for the largest share of fatalities. Data on the growth of SUVs within the U.S. vehicle fleet and academic research identify potential contributing factors as to why the number of SUVs involved in pedestrian fatalities increased between 2008 and 2018: Increasing SUV market share. SUVs represent a growing share of the total U.S. vehicle fleet. According to the Highway Loss Data Institute, the share of new vehicles in the United States that were SUVs grew from 30 percent in model year 2008 to 48 percent in model year 2018. In addition, 11 of the 13 auto manufacturers we interviewed stated that SUV sales, either market-wide or at their company, increased relative to passenger car sales in the United States since 2008. Increased risk of injuries based on vehicle size and weight. Research suggests that if a pedestrian is struck by a vehicle with greater mass the crash is more likely to result in serious injuries or a fatality than if the pedestrian is struck by a lower-mass vehicle. For example, one study we reviewed that cited work from five other studies found that the chief determinants for the severity of injuries in motor vehicle collisions are vehicle size and weight. According to one NHTSA-funded study, which used information from NHTSA\u2019s Pedestrian Crash Data Study, researchers found that the probability of death for pedestrians struck by light trucks (including SUVs) was 3.4 times higher than for pedestrians struck by passenger cars. Between 2008 and 2018, the number of pedestrian fatalities involving higher speeds (31 mph and above) at the time of the crash increased more sharply than the number involving lower speeds (30 mph and below). Although vehicle speed was missing or not reported for 62 percent of pedestrian fatalities (as discussed below), our analysis of FARS data showed that when speed data are recorded, the number of pedestrian fatalities involving vehicles reportedly travelling at higher speeds increased from 1,315 to 1,912 (45 percent) between 2008 and 2018 (see fig. 7). The number of pedestrian fatalities involving vehicles reportedly traveling at lower speeds also increased, but at a smaller percentage (28 percent) than vehicles at higher-speed. During this time period, about 79 percent of pedestrian fatalities involved vehicles travelling 31 mph and above, and about 21 percent involved vehicles traveling at lower speeds. Multiple studies have found that when vehicles travel at higher speeds and strike pedestrians, they are more likely to kill or severely injure the pedestrian. For example, the NTSB reported in 2018 that the relationship between speed and the severity of injuries is consistent and direct\u2014 higher crash speeds result in injuries that are more severe. The NTSB added that the effect of speed is especially critical for pedestrians because they lack protection. In addition, according to a 2019 report from the National Cooperative Highway Research Program, a pedestrian\u2019s risk of fatality is 90 percent when struck by vehicles travelling between 54 and 63 mph compared with a 10 percent risk of fatality between 24 and 33 mph. We also found that between 2008 and 2018, the speed of the striking vehicle was not reported for about 62 percent of pedestrian fatalities. This omission is likely because it is difficult for police officers to determine a vehicle\u2019s speed after a crash occurs. Further, some organizations we spoke with told us that low speed collisions were typically underreported. According to NHTSA officials, the speed recorded is generally up to the discretion of the responding police officer. NHTSA officials and other stakeholders we interviewed identified limitations in NHTSA\u2019s data on the relationship between vehicle characteristics and pedestrian injuries. These include (1) incomplete and inconsistent injury designations, (2) crash and vehicle information not linked to medical data, and (3) outdated pedestrian crash investigation data. Incomplete and inconsistent injury information. Within CRSS, NHTSA relies on information provided in police reports to determine national estimates of injured pedestrians. According to NHTSA officials, data from the police reports are typically after-the-fact descriptions of events and NHTSA conducts little, or no, follow up investigations of these reports. As a result, CRSS data may not include the cause of crashes or pedestrian injuries, and for some crashes it may be missing detailed information on specific characteristics of the striking vehicle. In addition, there may be inconsistencies in pedestrian injury information. NHTSA\u2019s injury severity data rely on reporting from states and localities, which may define injury severity differently, year-to-year. As we have reported, NHTSA standardized the injury severity definitions nationally in April 2019; however, it will take time for states to adopt this standard. Crash and vehicle data are not linked to medical records. According to NTSB and some researchers we spoke with, the five point injury severity scale used on police crash reports does not effectively capture injury severity or actual injury outcomes because NHTSA does not link crash data with medical and hospital records. Without crash and vehicle information linked to medical records, researchers cannot crosscheck injury severity designations with actual injury outcomes or identify specific injury types. NHTSA previously sponsored a program to help link crash data with injury data contained in medical records, but federal funding for the program was discontinued in 2013. Outdated pedestrian crash investigation data. NHTSA last collected detailed data on pedestrian crash and injury characteristics from 1994 to 1998. The Pedestrian Crash Data Study collected information from over 500 pedestrian crashes, including data on pedestrian injury types, severity, and potential causation. The study also reported the vehicle\u2019s type and the part of the vehicle that caused the injury, such as the front bumper. In its 2018 report, NTSB stated that while this study was the most complete set of pedestrian crash data available in the United States, the data are over 20 years old. NTSB recommended that NHTSA develop a detailed and current pedestrian crash data set for local and state analysis and to model and simulate pedestrian collision avoidance systems. As of February 2020, however, NHTSA had not fully implemented the recommendation. Some automakers and equipment suppliers we spoke with noted that improved real world injury data would help them better develop pedestrian safety features. NHTSA has recognized that it needs to collect more detailed and complete data on pedestrian injuries. For example, in a 2011 report to Congress on the agency\u2019s data gaps, NHTSA noted that internal stakeholders (those within NHTSA) requested an updated Pedestrian Crash Data Study with crashes involving late-model-year vehicles and detailed injury data on the body region impacted rather than the vehicle\u2019s point of contact. Further, in its 2016 to 2020 strategic plan, NHTSA stated that it would work to improve the quality, timeliness and relevance of safety data collected. In 2018, NHTSA initiated a pilot program to evaluate existing and new protocols for collecting pedestrian crash and injury data as part of its Crash Injury Research and Engineering Network (CIREN). The purpose of this pilot program is to develop a data collection protocol and collect preliminary data for pedestrian-motor vehicle crashes, including analysis on injury causation. Further, NHTSA stated that it intends to use this protocol and data as the foundation for subsequent pedestrian crash studies such as research related to injury trends and testing tools. NHTSA officials also told us that the pilot will help update and build upon the data collection and analysis protocols for pedestrian-motor vehicle crashes used in the 1990s in the Pedestrian Crash Data Study. According to NHTSA officials, the pilot will collect data on nine cases from two hospitals. A third hospital will provide engineering support. NHTSA officials stated that they limited the pilot study to nine cases so they would be able to act quickly on the pilot to determine if a full project was worth pursuing and to avoid delays. According to NHTSA officials, they expect initial results to be available by fall 2020. We have reported that a well-developed and documented pilot program can help ensure that agency assessments produce information needed to make effective program and policy decisions. Well-designed pilot programs use five leading practices including: 1. establishing clear, appropriate, and measurable objectives; 2. articulating an assessment methodology and data gathering strategy; 3. developing a data analysis and evaluation plan to track pilot 4. identifying criteria for determining whether and how to scale the pilot and integrate it into overall efforts; and 5. ensuring two-way stakeholder communication through the pilot program. Through our review of the CIREN pedestrian pilot program documentation, we determined that NHTSA met most of the criteria for a well-developed pilot program, but not all. Specifically, NHTSA documented clear, appropriate, and measureable project objectives; identified an assessment methodology and data gathering strategy; developed a data analysis plan; and communicated with stakeholders. NHTSA, however, did not establish an evaluation plan that includes criteria to determine if the pilot program\u2019s data collection and analysis protocol should or could be continued or expanded, once the data have been collected from the nine cases. Although NHTSA officials reported that they had a plan to review and evaluate individual cases, NHTSA does not have an evaluation plan for the pilot program that includes criteria or standards for identifying lessons learned or determining whether the new data collection and analysis procedures would satisfy data needs related to pedestrian\u2019s injuries. NHTSA officials told us that they did not develop an evaluation plan or criteria for determining the success or scalability of the pedestrian pilot program because they were not required to create one. They also said they did not have enough information to tell if the pilot program should be integrated into overall efforts, although they expect the tools developed by the pilot to be incorporated into later efforts to increase the number of pedestrian crashes reviewed under the CIREN program. Pedestrian crash avoidance and crash mitigation safety features are commonly available on many 2019 model year vehicles offered in the United States, according to the 13 automakers we interviewed. As previously discussed, crash avoidance features rely on cameras or radar or both to detect a pedestrian and take action to avoid a crash. Crash mitigation generally involves use of pedestrian-friendly vehicle components (such as energy absorbing bumper components or hoods) that are designed to reduce the severity of injuries should a pedestrian be hit. The 13 automakers we interviewed responded that they, collectively, offered 262 model year 2019 vehicles for sale in the United States. Of those vehicle models, almost 60 percent included pedestrian automatic emergency braking as either a standard or an optional feature (see fig. 8). About 62 percent of their model year 2019 vehicles had some type of standard pedestrian crash mitigation feature. In total, 12 of 13 automakers that we interviewed responded that they offered one or more 2019 model year vehicles with pedestrian automatic emergency braking as either a standard or optional feature; similarly, 12 of 13 automakers told us they offered crash mitigation features in at least one of their 2019 model year vehicles. Some stakeholders we interviewed told us that a combination of crash avoidance and crash mitigation features can be effective in minimizing pedestrian injury. For example, NHTSA officials told us that crash avoidance features, such as pedestrian automatic emergency braking can slow a vehicle to a speed where it will be less damaging to a pedestrian once struck, and if the vehicle also has crash mitigation features the impact of the crash can be further mitigated. We found that almost half of 2019 vehicle models had some combination of both pedestrian automatic emergency braking and crash mitigation features. For example, about 47 percent of 2019 vehicle models had pedestrian automatic emergency braking as either standard or optional equipment along with crash mitigation features, such as softer hoods. However, 24 percent of vehicle models had neither of these (see fig. 9). Officials from the 13 automakers we interviewed identified a variety of factors that influenced their decisions to offer vehicles with pedestrian safety features in the United States. These include a desire to achieve high safety ratings for their vehicles, as well as the following: New car assessment programs: New car assessment programs in the United States and other countries also influence why automakers may offer pedestrian safety features. For example, officials from nine of 10 automakers that responded to this question in our interview replied that Euro NCAP was a major factor to them in providing pedestrian safety features, while seven of 10 automakers responded that JNCAP was a major factor. In contrast, three of 11 automakers responded that the U.S. NCAP was a major factor in their decisions to offer vehicles with pedestrian safety features. As previously discussed, the United States, unlike the European Union and Japan, does not incorporate pedestrian safety tests into its NCAP. Independent safety testing: Independent safety testing was also a factor in why automakers may offer pedestrian safety features on vehicles. For example, officials from five automakers said that they considered IIHS safety ratings to be a major factor in their company\u2019s decision to offer pedestrian safety features on vehicles sold in the United States. As previously discussed, IIHS began testing pedestrian crash avoidance systems on 2018 and 2019 vehicles. These tests are known as pedestrian automatic emergency braking tests and in 2020 IIHS began using the results to help determine their Top Safety Pick awards. Officials from two automakers said a company\u2019s goal is to earn an IIHS top safety-pick rating for each of their models. Cost: Cost appeared to be less of a factor influencing whether pedestrian safety features were offered on vehicles. Officials from seven of eight automakers who responded to this question replied that costs either were a minor factor, or did not apply, in their decisions to offer vehicles with pedestrian safety features. However, officials from four automakers told us that, in general, while customers want safer vehicles, automakers have to consider what safety features could be included without increasing the overall cost. Further, one automaker\u2019s representative said that as more manufacturers and customers are buying crash avoidance systems the costs are decreasing. The future availability of crash avoidance features may depend on several factors. Specifically, in 2016, 20 automakers voluntarily committed to making automatic emergency braking systems standard in vehicles sold in the United States by 2022. Officials from three automakers said that they planned to incorporate pedestrian automatic emergency braking into their vehicles\u2019 automatic emergency braking systems as part of this commitment. Another factor is customer demand. One automaker said that the number of models that include pedestrian safety features in the future would depend on consumer demand or changes in regulation. Officials from another automaker said their customers often ask for features they see in Europe and ask why such features are available there but not in the United States. The auto industry officials we interviewed identified benefits and challenges with commonly available pedestrian safety features. Benefits of crash avoidance systems include the potential of eliminating or reducing car-to-pedestrian accidents. For example, officials from six automakers said that crash avoidance features were more effective than crash mitigation features because the purpose of crash avoidance features is to prevent the collision from occurring in the first place. Almost half of the automakers we interviewed (six of 13), however, reported that a primary challenge with a camera-based pedestrian automatic emergency braking system was the camera\u2019s ability to work in low lighting or poor weather. Recently issued research has raised questions about the overall effectiveness of crash avoidance systems. In October 2019, AAA reported that based on its own assessment, some vehicles\u2019 pedestrian safety systems were inconsistent at either slowing down or stopping a vehicle to avoid hitting a pedestrian. Specifically, the association reported that none of the crash avoidance systems on the four vehicles they tested worked in dark conditions. Auto industry officials also identified benefits and challenges with pedestrian crash mitigation features. For example, 12 of 13 automakers reported that crash mitigation features have the overall benefit of reducing the risk or severity of pedestrian injuries. Officials from eight automakers, however, said that the current federal bumper standard created challenges to offering softer, more pedestrian-friendly bumpers in the United States. Officials from the eight automakers said they offered softer bumpers in Europe or elsewhere\u2014where there is no similar bumper standard\u2014but do not offer softer bumpers in the United States. NHTSA officials told us the current bumper standard is primarily a cost savings standard in that it is intended to reduce repair costs and not necessarily to offer safety protection for vehicle occupants. NHTSA officials told us trade-offs are required to establish a bumper standard that addresses pedestrian safety, yet minimizes bumper damage and repair costs. NHTSA officials told us they are in the process of reevaluating the bumper damageability standard, as part of a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, which they expect to publish in 2020. Appendix III discusses the benefits and challenges of commonly available pedestrian safety features. NHTSA has considered pedestrian safety for many years by conducting research, considering implementation of global regulations for pedestrian crash mitigation tests, and proposing pedestrian crash avoidance and mitigation tests for NCAP (see fig. 10). NHTSA\u2019s last substantial update of NCAP was in July 2008 (with changes effective for model year 2011 vehicles). This update established additional crash tests and technical standards to protect vehicle occupants, but did not include pedestrian safety tests. In the past 10 years, NHTSA has considered but has not yet initiated a rulemaking process related to international standards for crash mitigation tests, among other actions. For example, in 2008, the United States along with other countries approved a United Nation\u2019s international standard for pedestrian crash mitigation tests. This international standard, if implemented in the United States in a domestic regulation, would require U.S. vehicles to meet minimum performance requirements in pedestrian crash mitigation tests. The United States approved the international standard in 2008; however, NHTSA has yet to initiate a rulemaking to implement it either as part of the FMVSS or adopt it as a testing protocol through NCAP. According to NHTSA officials, implementation of the standard would require NHTSA to initiate a regulatory proceeding. Although the United States formally agreed to the standard more than 10 years ago, NHTSA officials told us that the rulemaking initiative is classified as a long-term action and that there is no timeline for such a rulemaking to implement pedestrian crash mitigation requirements. NHTSA has also conducted a range of research on pedestrian crash avoidance and mitigation tests. Specifically, NHTSA has published, contributed to, or sponsored over 55 studies and presentations on pedestrian safety issues since 2008, and NHTSA officials provided information stating that NHTSA has spent over $8.4 million to research pedestrian safety, including pedestrian automatic emergency braking and passive safety features from 2008 through 2019. In addition, officials stated that NHTSA has conducted a number of additional studies related to pedestrian safety, studies that NHTSA is currently reviewing for final publication, though officials did not provide expected publication dates. NHTSA officials told us this research serves as a body of work that supports and facilitates agency decisions and policies with respect to pedestrian safety. NHTSA\u2019s pedestrian safety research has focused on several key issues, including developing objective test protocols and reliable test instruments for inclusion in NCAP and assessing the potential safety benefits. NHTSA officials told us there are three important elements associated with any safety tests (including pedestrian safety tests). These elements are (1) creating test protocols that measure a vehicle\u2019s safety performance objectively, (2) validating test instruments that measure human injury, and (3) estimating the potential safety benefit of the tests. NHTSA\u2019s pedestrian safety research includes work related to all three of these elements, as follows: Objective Test Protocols. One NHTSA study developed objective test protocols to evaluate the effectiveness of pedestrian crash avoidance systems based on analyses of crash scenarios from real- world crash data. Another NHTSA study applied pedestrian crash mitigation test protocols used by Euro NCAP to the U.S. vehicle fleet. NHTSA found that the European protocols could be used to assess the pedestrian safety performance of vehicles in the United States, but that the performance of different U.S. vehicle types could vary. Specifically, NHTSA found that \u201cglobal platform\u201d vehicles (i.e., models that include a U.S. and European variant of the same vehicle) offered more pedestrian safety than vehicles that are only marketed in the United States. Valid Test Instruments. NHTSA has been a key contributor in the development of pedestrian test instruments. For example, NHTSA has presented information on mannequins for evaluating the repeatability and accuracy of pedestrian crash avoidance systems, concluding that mannequins should be durable, realistic, and comparable in size and movement to humans. In addition, NHTSA found there are instruments that produce repeatable and reproducible measurements of pedestrian head, upper leg, and lower leg injuries on tests. Potential Safety Benefits. NHTSA has studied the potential benefits of pedestrian crash avoidance, and estimated that these technologies could reduce the number of annual vehicle-pedestrian crashes by between 620 and 5,000, and reduce the number of annual fatal vehicle-pedestrian crashes by between 110 and 810. NHTSA has also reported that Europe and Japan have responded to the high proportion of pedestrian fatalities compared to all traffic fatalities by including pedestrian protection in their respective NCAPs and requiring pedestrian protection through regulation. According to NHTSA, these actions have likely contributed to a downward trend in pedestrian fatalities in Europe and Japan. Further, an international study found that including pedestrian safety testing in consumer testing programs has real world benefits by reducing pedestrian fatalities and injuries. For example, a European study concluded that vehicles that score well in Euro NCAP pedestrian crash mitigation tests are less likely to severely injure pedestrians. As previously noted, Euro NCAP and JNCAP have included pedestrian crash mitigation tests since 1997 and 2003, respectively, and both Euro NCAP and JNCAP incorporated pedestrian crash avoidance tests in 2016. In December 2015, NHTSA proposed pedestrian crash avoidance and mitigation safety tests for NCAP by publishing a Request for Comments notice in the Federal Register. In the 2015 Request for Comments, NHTSA indicated that including these tests in NCAP could lead to a decrease in vehicle-pedestrian crashes and resulting pedestrian injuries and fatalities. In this request, NHTSA also reported that it believed the greatest gains in highway safety in coming years would result from widespread application of crash avoidance technologies and that its proposed safety tests for crash avoidance technologies, including pedestrian detection and automatic emergency braking, met NHTSA\u2019s four prerequisites for updating NCAP. Those four prerequisites include that: a safety need is known or capable of being estimated; vehicle and equipment designs exist (or are anticipated in prototype design) that are capable of mitigating the safety need; a safety benefit is estimated based on the anticipated performance of the existing or prototype design; and a performance-based, objective test procedure exists to measure the ability of the vehicle technology to mitigate the safety issue. With regard to crash mitigation tests, NHTSA reported that it intended to use the Euro NCAP test procedures rather than those used in Japan because the European fleet make-up, including vehicle sizes and classes, is more similar to the U.S. fleet. NHTSA also reported in its 2015 Request for Comments that including pedestrian crash mitigation tests in NCAP is necessary to stimulate improvements in pedestrian crashworthiness in new vehicles sold in the United States. NHTSA, however, did not state in its 2015 Request for Comments whether the proposed crash mitigation tests met NHTSA\u2019s prerequisites for updating NCAP, as it had for the crash avoidance tests. The proposed changes in the 2015 Request for Comment were to take effect for model year 2019 vehicles. In response to the 2015 Request for Comment, NHTSA officials told us they received 290 comments, 31 of which addressed pedestrian safety. According to the officials, the comments received were generally supportive of including pedestrian safety testing in NCAP, and commenters proposed that the U.S. tests should be consistent, or harmonized, with the tests already conducted by Euro NCAP. NHTSA officials also noted that some commenters expressed concern with test tools and proposed test scenarios. Since the 2015 proposal to include pedestrian tests in NCAP, NHTSA has continued to solicit updated information in additional Requests for Comments. Most recently, in October 2019 NHTSA announced it would seek comment on NCAP updates in 2020, and in November 2019, NHTSA requested comments on draft research test procedures for forward and rear pedestrian crash avoidance, among other technologies. However, NHTSA stated that its draft test procedures were developed for research purposes only, and the fact that it was soliciting comments on these procedures was not an indication that it would then, or at any time in the future, initiate a rulemaking related to that technology or include that technology in NCAP. NHTSA officials told us there are many actions that go into their decision- making on whether to update NCAP and that this decision-making process can take years. These actions include such things as reviewing data, ensuring the reliability and repeatability of proposed tests by validating protocols at multiple independent test laboratories, and conducting market research to obtain consumer input. In addition, NHTSA officials told us that it also uses its four prerequisites for updating NCAP, and while these prerequisites are not required by law, they represent good governance practices and are in consumers\u2019 best interest. However, since NCAP is considered a consumer testing information program and not a regulation, there are no particular requirements for when or how final decisions would be made as to whether pedestrian safety should or should not be included in NCAP. NHTSA officials told us that ultimately the NHTSA Administrator decides whether to go forward with changes to NCAP. Although NHTSA officials told us NCAP is not a regulation, they said NHTSA generally follows the processes in the Administrative Procedure Act for informal rulemaking to update NCAP. This process includes a notice, comment, and decision process in the Federal Register for transparency. NHTSA, however, has not used this process to communicate to stakeholders the additional steps that it must take before it can make its decision on NCAP testing. In addition, although NHTSA requested and received numerous comments on including pedestrian safety tests in NCAP in 2015, as of April 2020, it has yet to respond to those comments. Leading practices for program management emphasize the importance of milestones and decision points, documentation, and clearly communicating to external stakeholders. The Project Management Institute, Inc., The Standard for Program Management stresses the importance of program management plans that align with organizational goals and objectives. Elements of such plans are to provide a roadmap that identifies such things as milestones and decision points to guide programs forward. In addition, Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government, state that entities should externally communicate the necessary quality information to achieve the entity\u2019s objectives. In particular, entities should communicate to external stakeholders significant matters related to risks or changes. These standards also state that documentation is necessary for design, implementation, and operating effectiveness. Compared to these leading practices, NHTSA\u2019s process does not provide documentation of the process, decision points, or milestones to guide the program. For example, NHTSA officials could not provide us with documentation as to how it determined that the pedestrian crash avoidance tests proposed in 2015 met the four prerequisites, or how the proposed crash mitigation tests compared to the prerequisites. Other NCAPs have used various methods for documenting their process for updating their testing. For example, Euro NCAP uses a roadmap to communicate to stakeholders the planned changes for NCAP tests, the timeline of steps toward the changes, and when those changes will be effective. Officials from Euro NCAP told us the test and assessment protocols are developed in conjunction with working groups made up of automakers, equipment suppliers, test facilities, and Euro NCAP member organizations. Further, officials told us the working groups and roadmaps provide automakers with the opportunity to provide real-time input and obtain information to support their investment decisions. The lack of a documented overall process for updating NCAP affects NHTSA\u2019s ability to achieve NCAP\u2019s goals to provide manufacturers an incentive to improve the safety performance of new vehicles and to assist consumers with their vehicle purchasing decisions. Specifically, without a transparent process for NHTSA\u2019s decision-making on NCAP, automakers lack information on NHTSA\u2019s progress in evaluating proposed changes\u2014 such as those offered in the 2015 Request for Comment\u2014and the timing of the implementation of any specific testing procedures. This is particularly important because automakers need quality information to make investments to support the development and deployment of new technologies and equipment in their product lines to meet testing requirements. For example, representatives from one automaker told us that vehicle design is a 6 to 8 year product cycle and that if NHTSA decides to implement certain tests in the middle of that cycle, it would be difficult and costly to make changes. Without a clearly documented process for making changes to NCAP, including established criteria and milestones for decisions, automakers and the public lack clarity on NHTSA\u2019s plans for improving vehicle safety to inform investment and purchasing decisions. NHTSA has yet to make or communicate a decision as to whether it intends to include pedestrian safety tests in NCAP. As discussed above, NHTSA has conducted extensive research and requested comments on pedestrian crash avoidance and mitigation tests in 2013 and 2015. Although NHTSA reported in 2015 that these tests could lead to a decrease in vehicle-pedestrian crashes and resulting pedestrian injuries and fatalities, it has yet to make or communicate a decision about the future of NCAP in relation to pedestrian safety to stakeholders. Nine of 13 automakers we interviewed told us that a lack of communication from NHTSA on its plan for addressing pedestrian safety issues has presented a challenge to them, often because they require long lead times to develop, test, and launch new technologies. Leading practices for program management also stress the importance of communication with stakeholders and that effective stakeholder communications are key to executing program endeavors, addressing risks, and, ultimately, delivering benefits. Specifically: The Project Management Institute, Inc., The Standard for Program Management stresses the importance of managing external communications, stating that communication provides critical links for successful decision making. It also stresses the importance of providing decision-making stakeholders with adequate information to make the right decisions at the right time in order to move programs forward. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government states that entities should identify, analyze, and respond to risks related to achieving the defined objectives and should externally communicate the necessary quality information to achieve the entity\u2019s objectives. As discussed above, these standards also state that management should externally communicate quality information to external stakeholders significant matters related to risks or changes. Further, the statute underlying NCAP requires NHTSA to communicate certain vehicle safety information to the public. Specifically, DOT is to provide the public with information on crash avoidance, crashworthiness, and damage susceptibility. Such information is to be provided in a simple and understandable form to allow comparison among vehicles to assist a consumer in buying a new car. NHTSA officials told us that it has not made or communicated a decision as to whether it will include pedestrian safety testing in NCAP because administration priorities have shifted since publication of the 2015 Request for Comments. Specifically, NHTSA officials told us that the agency drafted technical specifications and testing protocols for pedestrian safety tests for NCAP and posted those tests to its public web site in January 2017. After the administration changed, however, those specifications were withdrawn and not published in the Federal Register. NHTSA officials told us that, since that time, the agency has sought to conduct additional review before final decisions could be made. Although the policy decision as to whether to include pedestrian safety tests in NCAP ultimately resides within NHTSA\u2019s discretion, NHTSA\u2019s lack of a decision and its related rationale limits NHTSA\u2019s ability to address emerging safety risks and to meet its strategic objectives. Specifically, in the Department of Transportation\u2019s Enterprise Risk Profile for 2019, NHTSA recognized that increases in roadway fatalities in general\u2014and pedestrian fatalities in particular\u2014represent one of the top strategic risk areas for the Department. The document states that to meet its objectives, NHTSA must focus on areas where there have been increases in road deaths, including pedestrian fatalities, and advance crash avoidance and mitigation technology to prevent crashes from occurring. NHTSA also recognized the importance of using a data-driven and systematic approach that is timely and complete when making decisions. In the absence of a decision on whether to include pedestrian safety testing in NCAP, and the rationale for that decision, stakeholders lack clarity on whether NHTSA is using all of the policy tools at its disposal to address emerging safety risks and to achieve its strategic objectives. The design of vehicles and the safety features they offer can play an important role in reducing the frequency and severity of pedestrian crashes. NHTSA\u2019s pedestrian pilot program is an important step toward addressing data gaps on the relationship between vehicle characteristics and pedestrian injuries. Without an evaluation plan that includes criteria for assessing the scalability of the pilot program, however, NHTSA lacks the tools necessary to assess whether and how the pilot should be expanded into a more robust effort to inform NHTSA\u2019s understanding of pedestrian injury mitigation efforts. Although NHTSA has recognized that the increase in pedestrian fatalities presents a risk to the safety of the nation\u2019s roadways, it is not well positioned to address this risk through NCAP because NHTSA does not have a clear process for making changes to the program. Documenting and communicating the process for updating NCAP, with clear criteria and decision points, would enhance NHTSA\u2019s accountability to key stakeholders\u2014including Congress, automakers, and consumers\u2014and help NHTSA communicate the important policy decision as to whether to include pedestrian safety tests in NCAP. Making and communicating a decision regarding pedestrian safety testing would give automakers clarity on whether NHTSA intends to establish performance standards and tests to evaluate the pedestrian safety features that are commonly available on new vehicle models. Communicating a decision and the rationale for that decision would provide transparency and accountability to the public. We are making the following three recommendations to NHTSA. The Administrator of NHTSA should document an evaluation plan for the Crash Injury Research and Engineering Network pedestrian pilot program that includes criteria for determining whether and how to scale the pilot program to ensure that the piloted data-collection and analysis procedures will address NHTSA\u2019s data needs related to pedestrian injuries and vehicle characteristics. (Recommendation 1) The Administrator of NHTSA should document the overall process for making changes to NCAP, including established criteria and milestones for decisions, and share this process with external stakeholders. (Recommendation 2) The Administrator of NHTSA should decide whether to include pedestrian safety tests in NCAP and NHTSA should communicate this decision and rationale to relevant stakeholders and the public. (Recommendation 3) We provided a draft of this report to the Department of Transportation for review and comment. The department provided a written response, which is reprinted in appendix IV, and technical comments that we incorporated as appropriate in the report. The department concurred with all three of our recommendations. It described various activities NHTSA has underway related to pedestrian safety, including the CIREN study, a special study initiated this year to gather detailed data on a selection of fatal pedestrian crashes, and continuing research on pedestrian crash test procedures. Regarding Recommendation 2, the department stated that it has made its procedures to change NCAP transparent and inclusive of the public. Specifically, the department stated it has published and requested comment on its proposals in the Federal Register, as we described in this report. However, the department agreed that documenting the overall process on its website would generate increased public awareness of NCAP as a consumer safety tool. While such a step could increase public awareness of NCAP, we continue to believe that any steps taken to document the overall process for making changes to NCAP should also include established criteria and milestones for decisions to enhance NHTSA\u2019s accountability to Congress, automakers, and consumers. We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional committees, the Secretary of Transportation, and the Administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. In addition, we will make copies available to others upon request, and the report will be available at no charge on the GAO website at http://www.gao.gov. If you or your staff have any questions about this report, please contact me at (202) 512-2834, or vonaha@gao.gov. Contact points for our Offices of Congressional Relations and Public Affairs may be found on the last page of this report. GAO staff who made key contributions to this report are listed in appendix V. This report: (1) examines what is known about the relationship between motor vehicle characteristics and pedestrian injuries and fatalities, (2) describes approaches automakers have taken to address pedestrians\u2019 safety and discusses stakeholders\u2019 perspectives on these approaches, and (3) evaluates actions the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has taken to assess whether pedestrian safety testing should be included in its New Car Assessment Program (NCAP). For all of our objectives we reviewed pertinent federal statutes and regulations and applicable program documents. Our work covered the 2008 through 2018 timeframe, with 2018 being the most recent data available at the time of our analysis. We focused on motor vehicles as opposed to infrastructure (e.g., roadway design, highway lighting) or driver/pedestrian behavior. Although infrastructure and behavior may also contribute to pedestrian fatalities and injuries, the scope of this report was to assess motor vehicles and their role in pedestrian safety. We defined motor vehicles as passenger cars, sport utility vehicles, and light trucks and vans that were offered for sale in the United States. We excluded commercial vehicles, motorcycles, and buses. The intent was to include those vehicles that a typical consumer would purchase and the pedestrian safety features that may or may not be offered on such vehicles. Our scope also included gaining an understanding of pedestrian safety testing activities in Europe (European New Car Assessment Programme (Euro NCAP)) and Japan (Japan New Car Assessment Program (JNCAP)). We selected these programs since pedestrian safety testing is part of their NCAPs and some auto industry stakeholders identified them as being in the forefront of this type of testing. Both Europe and Japan began testing crash avoidance systems as part of their NCAPs in 2016. We interviewed officials with Euro NCAP, received a written response to questions from JNCAP, and obtained information on pedestrian safety testing from both organizations. To examine what is known about the relationship between vehicle characteristics and pedestrian injuries and fatalities, we analyzed data from three NHTSA databases for the period of 2008 through 2018: (1) Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS); (2) Crash Report Sampling Systems (CRSS); and (3) National Automotive Sampling System/General Estimates System (NASS/GES). To ensure the accuracy of our analysis we reviewed agency technical documentation related to these databases and ensured that our figures matched publicly available injury and fatality data contained in NHTSA publications such as its annual Traffic Safety Fact Sheets. FARS data are derived from a census of all fatal motor vehicle traffic crashes within the 50 states, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia and provide uniformly coded, national data on police reported fatalities. We analyzed FARS data to determine the total number of pedestrian fatalities each year as well as the number of pedestrian fatalities by vehicle age, vehicle body type, and vehicle travelling speed (speed just prior to the crash). These variables were selected based on our interviews of NHTSA officials and a review of relevant research about the relationship between pedestrian fatalities and motor vehicle characteristics. We also analyzed FARS data on the number of pedestrian fatalities by environmental characteristics such as type of roadway, light condition, and relationship to intersection, selecting these characteristics based on our interviews and research. CRSS is a sample of police reported motor vehicle crashes involving all types of motor vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists that is used to develop national estimates of the number of injuries associated with motor vehicle crashes, among other things. The CRSS police crash report sample is selected in multiple stages to produce a nationally representative probability sample, and the target annual sample size is 50,000 police accident reports. We analyzed CRSS data from 2016 through 2018, the only years CRSS data were available, to better understand the estimated total number of pedestrian crashes as well as the estimated number of pedestrian crashes by vehicle age, vehicle body type, vehicle speed, and level of pedestrian injury severity. Similar to our analysis of FARS data, these variables were selected based on our interviews with NHTSA officials and a review of relevant research about the relationship between motor vehicle characteristics and pedestrian crashes. NASS/GES preceded CRSS and obtained its data from a nationally representative probability sample of police accident reports. We analyzed NASS/GES data from 2008 through 2015, the most recent years available within the database, to better understand historical trend data on the variables we analyzed in CRSS. Although NHTSA collected similar variables in CRSS and NASS/GES, differences in the sampling methodologies of each may contribute to differences in the estimated number of pedestrian crashes between 2008 through 2015 and 2016 through 2018 timeframes. We used agency technical documentation for CRSS and NASS/GES as well as guidance from NHTSA statisticians to estimate the sampling error associated with our estimates derived from CRSS and NASS/GES data. We express confidence levels of estimates derived from CRSS and NASS/GES data at the 95 percent confidence interval. This level means that we are 95 percent confident that the actual population values are within this interval. Additionally, for our analysis, we used CRSS and NASS/GES variables that included imputed values for items missing data on the estimated number of pedestrian crashes by vehicle age, vehicle body type, and pedestrian injury severity. We reviewed and assessed NHTSA technical documentation for their statistical imputation methodology and determined it was sufficiently reliable for us to make use of the vehicle age, body type, and injury severity variables with imputed data. In addition to analyzing NHTSA databases, we analyzed data from the Highway Loss Data Institute (HLDI), an organization affiliated with the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS), to better understand how the U.S. vehicle fleet has changed, specifically between 2008 and 2018. HLDI collected and decoded vehicle identification numbers (VINs) for each model year between 1983 and 2018. For HLDI\u2019s analysis, it used VINs from its member companies, among other sources, and information encoded in the VIN to determine the body styles for these VINs. According to HLDI, passenger cars include regular two-door models, regular four-door models, station wagons, minivans, sports models and luxury models, while SUVs are vehicles with conventional front-end constructions and large passenger and cargo areas which can be built on either heavy-duty chassis capable of off-road use or passenger car platforms. HLDI definitions for vehicle body type classifications differ from those used by NHTSA. According to HLDI officials, however, the classifications are comparable. For our analysis, we used these data to calculate the proportion of vehicles that were passenger cars, light trucks, or SUVs from 2008 through 2018. We also conducted interviews with federal government and non- governmental organizations about the relationship between vehicle related characteristics and pedestrian injuries and fatalities, as well as issues related to NHTSA\u2019s pedestrian safety data and potential data gaps and limitations. To discuss NHTSA\u2019s pedestrian safety data, we spoke with NHTSA officials from the Data Reporting and Information Division, Mathematical Analysis Division, and Vehicle Research and Test Center. We also spoke with officials from the National Transportation Safety Board, which conducts independent accident investigations and advocates for safety improvements, including those related to pedestrian safety and motor vehicles. Non-governmental organizations we spoke with included IIHS and major auto industry trade associations, such as the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, Association of Global Automakers, the Motor and Equipment Manufacturers Association, and the Automotive Safety Council. We also spoke with vehicle safety advocates, such as the Governors Highway Safety Association. These organizations were selected based on their relationship to the auto industry, referrals from other interviewees, and recent publications on pedestrian-motor vehicle safety issues. We also identified and reviewed studies either published or referenced by these organizations to better understand research related to pedestrian injuries and fatalities and motor vehicle characteristics. Where appropriate, we conducted a methodological review of these studies. Further, we spoke with academic researchers from six research centers across four universities with expertise in human-vehicle interaction and pedestrian-motor vehicle safety, including injury biomechanics and auto industry data analysis. These researchers were selected based on referrals from other interviewees and reviews of their organization\u2019s websites to ensure that their research would be informative for our purposes. Although these organizations had, or have, relationships with NHTSA or the auto industry, we included them based on their expertise with issues related to our work. Based on these criteria we interviewed officials at the University of Virginia (Center for Applied Biomechanics); the Ohio State University (Center for Automotive Research; Injury Biomechanics Research Center); the University of North Carolina (Highway Safety Research Center), and the University of Michigan (University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute; International Center for Automotive Medicine). We conducted interviews with these researchers to better understand general information on the relationship between vehicle-related characteristics and pedestrian injuries and fatalities, uses and limitations of NHTSA data, and potential areas for further research. Results of our interviews are not generalizable to the universe of non-governmental organizations or researchers studying pedestrian-motor vehicle safety. We also spoke with automakers and equipment suppliers about pedestrian safety and data needs. The automakers and equipment suppliers were the same as those contacted about how automakers are addressing pedestrian safety (discussed below). Finally, we reviewed documents and interviewed NHTSA officials about the Crash Injury Research and Engineering Network (CIREN) and the associated CIREN pedestrian pilot program NHTSA recently initiated. This pilot will assess data collection approaches and methodologies for pedestrian injuries resulting from motor vehicle crashes. Specifically, we reviewed CIREN contract and methodology documents such as the 2016 CIREN Request for Proposal, 2018 CIREN Pedestrian Pilot Study Request for Proposal, Task Orders for CIREN centers participating in the pedestrian pilot study, CIREN Pedestrian Crash Process and Coding Manual, and the Pedestrian Crash Inclusion Criteria. We also interviewed NHTSA officials responsible for managing the CIREN program and the pedestrian pilot study. We assessed this program using criteria for designing successful pilot programs developed during prior GAO work. To describe the approaches automakers have taken to address pedestrian-motor vehicle safety and discuss stakeholder perspectives on these approaches, we contacted automakers that sell new vehicles in the United States. Specifically, NHTSA provided us with a list of 17 automakers that participated in the 2018 New Car Assessment Program. NHTSA officials told us they do not necessarily include automakers with low sales volumes in NCAP testing. As a result, to better ensure that we had a complete list of automakers that sell vehicles in the United States we compared the names on NHTSA\u2019s listing to the membership lists of the Alliance for Automobile Manufacturers and the Association of Global Automakers\u2014two major trade associations of the auto industry. Officials told us that between the two organizations we would account for most, if not all, of the automakers that sell new vehicles in the United States. Finally, we compared our list with 2018 market share data from Ward\u2019s Automotive to identify the automakers with the highest U.S. sales. Based on our analysis, we identified 17 automakers to include in our work. However, during our contacts with automakers, we determined that one of the 17 automakers\u2014Porsche\u2014was part of the Volkswagen Group. Thus, our final review resulted in a total of 16 automakers to contact as part of our study (see table 2). Thirteen of the 16 automakers responded to our request for information. We developed a semi-structured interview instrument to collect information from the automakers. This instrument focused on the approaches that automakers took to address pedestrian-motor vehicle safety. The semi-structured interview instrument was peer reviewed by an independent survey specialist and pretested with two automakers before we began collecting data. Based upon on their responses, we revised and clarified the semi-structured interview instrument. In total, 13 of 16 automakers completed and submitted the semi-structured interview instrument. Those 13 automakers represented approximately 70 percent of new vehicle sales in the United States for 2018. The interview instrument asked automakers to identify pedestrian safety features on their 2019 model year vehicles, as these vehicles would have the most recent pedestrian safety features available at the time of our work. Although 12 of the 13 automakers did not respond in full to all the questions on the semi-structured interview instrument, we obtained additional information through telephone and in-person interviews conducted from May 2019 through October 2019. The results of these interviews are not generalizable to the universe of automakers that may sell vehicles in the United States. Upon completion of all the interviews, a GAO methodologist compiled the individual responses from each of the 13 automakers into a database. We used this database to perform a qualitative content analysis to identify common themes and the frequency with which the automakers identified certain issues related to pedestrian safety. A GAO analyst independently verified the themes and certain other information we received from the automakers to ensure accuracy and completeness. We also used semi-structured interview instruments to obtain information on stakeholders\u2019 perspectives on the approaches automakers have taken to pedestrian safety. For purposes of this report, we define stakeholders as automakers, auto equipment suppliers, and auto industry trade associations. These organizations develop or deploy pedestrian safety technology in motor vehicles, or, in the case of the trade associations, are knowledgeable about the legal and regulatory issues related to pedestrian safety and the auto industry. In addition to interviewing 13 automakers, we interviewed officials from five auto equipment suppliers and four auto industry trade associations (see table 3). The five auto equipment suppliers included in our work were identified with the assistance of the Motor and Equipment Manufacturers Association, a trade association for auto industry suppliers. The organization provided us the names of seven equipment suppliers, five of which agreed to participate in our semi- structured interviews. In general, these equipment suppliers develop or produce equipment used in motor vehicle crash avoidance or crash mitigation systems. The semi-structured interview instrument asked questions about such things as crash avoidance and crash mitigation technology and the benefits and challenges of this technology. We did not assess the effectiveness of these features. Additionally, we interviewed officials from four auto industry trade associations. We conducted telephone and in-person interviews with these stakeholders from March 2019 through September 2019. In addition to automakers, equipment suppliers, and auto industry trade associations, we also interviewed NHTSA and IIHS about crash avoidance and crash mitigation technology and reviewed applicable federal regulations related to pedestrian safety. These include federal headlight and bumper standards. We also reviewed an October 2018 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in which NHTSA agreed to evaluate proposed amendments to current federal motor vehicle headlight requirements. We discussed with NHTSA the federal headlight and bumper standards and how these relate to pedestrian safety, as well as any potential changes to these standards to better accommodate pedestrian safety. Lastly, we reviewed an October 2019 IIHS press release and an October 2019 American Automobile Association study discussing the results of pedestrian crash avoidance tests each organization performed. To assess NHTSA\u2019s actions related to pedestrian safety and NCAP, we reviewed applicable federal laws and regulations related to vehicle safety as well as documents published in the Federal Register, such as Requests for Comments, soliciting comments on proposed NCAP changes related to pedestrian safety. NHTSA provided a high-level summary of comments received from Requests for Comments issued in 2015 and 2018 that we reviewed. We reviewed selected comments and supporting documents submitted to NHTSA as part of the docket in support of the Requests for Comment, such as those provided by auto industry trade associations, automakers, and auto equipment suppliers. We also reviewed program documents discussing how NHTSA assesses new car safety, performs NCAP safety tests, and reports the results to the public. Further, we reviewed over 55 studies and presentations on the agency\u2019s work related to pedestrian safety. NHTSA highlighted 22 of these reports and presentations as being representative of the body of research that supported and facilitated agency decisions and policies with respect to pedestrian safety, including the 2015 and 2018 Requests for Comments. We reviewed the 22 reports and presentations and determined that 14 met our inclusion criteria, in that the reports and presentations were focused on potential pedestrian safety tests and their applicability to the U.S. vehicle fleet, the use of various test instruments, and the potential safety effects associated with technologies intended to avoid and mitigate crashes. Where appropriate, we conducted a methodological review of these studies. In addition, NHTSA officials provided additional studies after our interviews, which we also reviewed. To better understand pedestrian safety testing and issues related to incorporating such testing into NCAP, we visited NHTSA\u2019s Vehicle Research and Test Center in East Liberty, Ohio. We interviewed officials there about NHTSA pedestrian safety research and how it supported NHTSA\u2019s proposed pedestrian safety tests for NCAP. We also discussed the applicability of pedestrian safety tests to the U.S. vehicle fleet, including tests used by Euro NCAP. During our visit, we observed examples of a pedestrian crash mitigation test for lower leg injury and a rear-facing pedestrian crash avoidance test. We reviewed NHTSA\u2019s budget documentation on pedestrian safety research from fiscal year 2008 to 2019, the most recent year for which data were available. We also visited and discussed pedestrian safety issues with officials of IIHS\u2019 Vehicle Research Center in Ruckersville, Virginia. We observed a forward-facing pedestrian crash avoidance test. Further, we interviewed NHTSA officials about such things as the process for making changes to NCAP and activities associated with this process, documentation of this process, how NCAP changes are communicated to stakeholders, and NHTSA plans for determining whether to incorporate pedestrian safety tests in NCAP. Finally, we interviewed automakers, auto industry equipment suppliers, and IIHS about incorporating pedestrian safety tests into NCAP. To understand how other NCAPs address pedestrian safety, we interviewed officials from Euro NCAP and received written responses from JNCAP to a set of questions we sent them. We also reviewed supporting documents from both Euro NCAP and JNCAP on pedestrian crash avoidance and mitigation tests they perform and how such tests are scored when determining star ratings. Further, we discussed with Euro NCAP how it works with the auto industry to test vehicles and to develop future changes to Euro NCAP, including the Euro NCAP roadmap. We also reviewed selected international studies related to the real-world benefits of pedestrian safety testing performed by Euro NCAP. We determined those studies to be sufficiently reliable for our purposes. To assess how NHTSA\u2019s process for making changes to NCAP compares to leading practices, we reviewed the Project Management Institute, Inc., The Standard for Program Management, and GAO\u2019s Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government. The Project Management Institute\u2019s standards are utilized worldwide and provide guidance on how to manage various aspects of projects, programs, and portfolios. In particular, according to The Standard for Program Management, this standard provides guidance that is generally recognized to support good program-management practices for most programs, most of the time. We conducted our work from February 2019 to April 2020 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. This appendix contains additional information on pedestrian fatalities and the estimated number of pedestrians injured from 2008 through 2018. Although we included much of our pedestrian fatality analysis in the report, this appendix includes data on the number of pedestrian fatalities involving particular light conditions and relationships to intersections\u2014 environmental factors relevant to pedestrian crashes\u2014as well as data on vehicle body types (see fig. 11, 12, and 13). We used data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration\u2019s (NHTSA) Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) to compile information on pedestrian fatalities. The following figures show information about the estimated number of pedestrians injured from 2008 through 2018 (see figs. 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18). These figures show pedestrians injured by age of the striking vehicle, body type of vehicle, reported speed of the vehicles, and estimated number of pedestrians with serious or fatal injuries. We used data from NHTSA\u2019s Crash Report Sampling System (CRSS) for years 2016 through 2018, and National Automotive Sampling System/General Estimates Survey (NASS/GES) for years 2008 through 2015 to compile information on pedestrians injured. Within CRSS and NASS/GES databases, we specifically analyzed data on pedestrians injured by vehicle related characteristics such as the age, body type, and speed of vehicles that struck and injured pedestrians, as well as the estimated number of severe and fatal pedestrians injured. As part of our analysis on how automakers are addressing pedestrian safety through crash avoidance and crash mitigation technologies, we obtained the views of 13 automakers and five auto equipment suppliers. As discussed below, auto industry officials provided their views on the benefits and challenges of commonly available crash avoidance and crash mitigation technologies. Automaker and auto equipment supplier officials identified various benefits and challenges with pedestrian crash avoidance features. For example, 12 of 13 automakers reported and two of five auto equipment suppliers said that crash avoidance features have the overall potential benefit of eliminating or reducing car-to-pedestrian accidents. The Highway Loss Data Institute reported in 2017 that one automaker\u2019s pedestrian automatic emergency braking system reduced pedestrian- related bodily injury liability claims by 35 percent compared to other vehicles manufactured by that automaker. In addition, the automaker itself found that, in Japan, its vehicles equipped with the system experienced 60 percent fewer accidents with injury compared to its vehicles without the system. Officials from automakers and auto equipment suppliers we interviewed also identified challenges with pedestrian crash avoidance technologies. Specifically, stakeholders cited some distinctions between the performance of camera-based and radar-based pedestrian automatic emergency breaking systems. Almost half of the automakers we interviewed (six of 13) reported that a primary challenge with a camera- based pedestrian automatic emergency braking system was the camera\u2019s ability to work in low lighting and poor weather. As previously noted in this report, about 75 percent of all reported pedestrian fatalities occurred in 2018 after dark. In contrast, several automakers stated that radar based pedestrian detection systems are not dependent on light to function, but that they are less effective at identifying pedestrians than camera-based systems. Officials from another automaker said manufacturers have attempted to offset the challenges of cameras and radar by developing \u201cfusion\u201d systems (combination of camera and radar). These officials said, however, these systems add complexity and processing time to the technology because the system must manage two separate functions that must be processed together to identify a pedestrian. Officials from automakers said that a challenge affecting both camera- and radar-based systems was limiting the occurrence of false positives, or the activation of these systems when they are not required. Recently issued research has raised questions about the overall effectiveness of crash avoidance systems. In October 2019, the American Automobile Association (AAA) reported that, based on its own assessment, some vehicles\u2019 pedestrian safety systems were inconsistent at either slowing down or stopping a vehicle to avoid hitting a pedestrian. For example, AAA reported that dark conditions could affect the effectiveness of available pedestrian detection systems and that none of the crash avoidance systems on the four vehicles they tested worked in dark conditions. Automaker officials told us that the performance of crash avoidance systems could be improved through updates to current vehicle headlight standards. Specifically, officials from four automakers indicated that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) should update federal standards for headlights to permit the use of adaptive driving beam headlights on new vehicles. Adaptive driving beam headlights are currently in use in European and other countries, and are different from the combination high- and low-beam systems used in the United States. In general, adaptive driving beam headlights use advanced sensors and computing technology to shape the headlamp beams to provide enhanced illumination of unoccupied portions of the road and avoid glaring other vehicles. In October 2018, NHTSA published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in which it tentatively concluded that federal standards for headlights do not permit adaptive driving beam systems because those systems would not comply with some of the standards. NHTSA, however, has said adaptive driving beam headlights have the potential to create significant safety benefits in avoiding collisions with pedestrians, cyclists, animals, and roadside objects by providing additional front-end illumination. Five automakers we interviewed said that they offer adaptive driving beam headlamps as a crash avoidance technology on their vehicles sold in other countries. In its October 2018 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, NHTSA sought public comment on amending federal standards to allow the use of adaptive driving beam systems in response to a petition from an automaker. NHTSA officials said that it is in the process of developing a final rule but did not have a period for when it would be issued. Another challenge for crash avoidance systems is the federal standard for bumpers. As previously discussed in this report, this standard requires that vehicles, including their bumpers, meet specified damage criteria when bumpers are hit at 2.5 miles-per-hour (mph). Officials from five automakers said that this standard presented challenges with the placement of crash avoidance sensors. On some vehicles, crash avoidance sensors are placed in the same area where the vehicles are tested for compliance with the bumper standard. As a result, the test could damage or destroy the crash avoidance sensor. Two automaker officials told us that they have addressed this challenge by relocating the sensors to another part of the vehicle to avoid conflicts with the bumper standard. NHTSA officials told us they are in the process of reevaluating the bumper damageability standard, including the placement of sensors, as part of a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, which they expect to publish in early 2020. Officials from automakers and auto equipment suppliers we interviewed identified benefits and challenges for pedestrian crash mitigation features. For example, 12 of 13 automakers reported and one of five auto equipment suppliers said that pedestrian crash mitigation features have the overall benefit of reducing the risk or severity of pedestrian injuries. Officials from four automakers, however, said that crash mitigation features do not protect pedestrians from the secondary impact of an accident, such as the residual injuries from hitting the pavement. Additionally, officials from six automakers said that crash avoidance features were more effective than crash mitigation features because the purpose of crash avoidance features is to prevent the collision from occurring in the first place. Similar to crash avoidance, the federal bumper standard may also affect crash mitigation systems. Officials from eight automakers said that the bumper standard created challenges to offering additional crash mitigation features in the United States, such as softer, more pedestrian friendly bumpers. Officials from the eight automakers said they offered softer bumpers in Europe or elsewhere\u2014where there is no similar bumper standard\u2014but do not offer softer bumpers in the United States. Some stakeholders told us the current bumper standard runs counter to pedestrian safety, and softer bumpers would help mitigate the severity of pedestrian injuries. Similarly, NHTSA officials told us the current bumper standard is primarily a cost savings standard in that it is intended to reduce repair costs and not necessarily to offer safety protection for vehicle occupants. NHTSA officials told us that establishing a bumper standard that addresses pedestrian safety, yet minimizes bumper damage and repair costs requires tradeoffs. The officials told us as part of the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking it is reviewing the broader damageability requirement.

    "human_reference": "In 2018, about 6,300 pedestrians\u201417 per day\u2014died in collisions with motor vehicles in the United States, up from about 4,400 in 2008. Many factors influence pedestrian fatalities, including driver and pedestrian behavior. Vehicle characteristics are also a factor. NHTSA tests and rates new vehicles for safety and reports the results to the public through its NCAP. Currently, pedestrian safety tests are not included in NCAP. This report examines: (1) what is known about the relationship between vehicle characteristics and pedestrian fatalities and injuries, (2) approaches automakers have taken to address pedestrian safety, and (3) actions NHTSA has taken to assess whether pedestrian safety tests should be included in NCAP. GAO analyzed data on pedestrian fatalities and injuries from 2008 through 2018 (the most recent available data); reviewed NHTSA reports; and interviewed NHTSA officials. GAO also obtained information about pedestrian safety features from 13 automakers that represented about 70 percent of new vehicle sales in the United States in 2018, and compared NHTSA's actions with leading program management practices. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) data show that certain vehicle characteristics related to age, body type, and the speed of the vehicle at the time of the crash are associated with increases in pedestrian fatalities from 2008 to 2018. Specifically, the number of pedestrian fatalities during this time period increased more for crashes involving vehicles that were: 11 years old or older compared to newer vehicles, sport utility vehicles compared to other passenger vehicles, and traveling over 30 miles per hour compared to vehicles traveling at lower speeds. GAO also found that NHTSA does not consistently collect detailed data on the type and severity of pedestrian injuries, but began a pilot program in 2018 to improve its data collection efforts. NHTSA, however, lacks an evaluation plan with criteria to assess whether to expand the pilot program, as called for in leading practices. As a result, NHTSA lacks information to determine how and whether it should expand the pilot to meet the agency's data needs. Automakers offer a range of approaches to address pedestrian safety. For example, pedestrian crash avoidance technologies use cameras or radar to detect an imminent crash with a pedestrian and engage a vehicle's brakes to avoid a crash. GAO found that about 60 percent of the model year 2019 vehicles offered in the United States by 13 automakers had pedestrian crash avoidance technologies as standard or optional equipment. In 2015 NHTSA proposed pedestrian safety tests for its New Car Assessment Program (NCAP), but NHTSA has not decided whether it will include such tests in the program. NHTSA has reported that crash avoidance technologies could lead to a decrease in pedestrian fatalities. Nine automakers that GAO interviewed reported that NHTSA's lack of communication about pedestrian safety tests creates challenges for new product development. NHTSA has also not documented a clear process for updating NCAP with milestones for decisions. NHTSA officials said that updating NCAP involves many actions and can take years. However, absent a final decision on whether to include pedestrian safety tests in NCAP and a documented process for making such decisions, the public lacks clarity on NHTSA's efforts to address safety risks. GAO is recommending that NHTSA (1) develop an evaluation plan with criteria for expanding its pilot program, (2) make and communicate a decision about whether to include pedestrian safety tests in NCAP, and (3) document the process for making changes to NCAP. The Department of Transportation concurred with our recommendations.",

    "document": "Federal agencies conduct a variety of activities related to animal research. These activities include: funding intramural research conducted by agency personnel at federal facilities; funding extramural research conducted by universities, industrial firms, and other nonfederal entities through contracts, grants, or cooperative agreements; establishing guidelines for regulating products that may have been tested for safety or efficacy using animals; and overseeing the welfare of animals used for research. Table 1 shows key activities related to animal research or use that HHS, USDA and EPA and their component agencies and offices are involved in through their funding of intramural and extramural research and regulation of products. Some agencies within USDA and HHS have roles in overseeing animal welfare at federal and nonfederal research facilities. Under the Animal Welfare Act and its implementing regulations, USDA\u2019s APHIS oversees federal and nonfederal research facilities to ensure the humane treatment of covered species of warm-blooded animals when they are used in research, teaching, testing, or experimentation. These species include dogs, cats, nonhuman primates, guinea pigs, hamsters, rabbits, horses used for research purposes, and (with certain exceptions) other warm- blooded animals. Requirements under the act related to consideration of alternatives to animal research include the following: Under the act, research facilities are to appoint an animal care and use committee to, at least semiannually, review the facility\u2019s program for humane care and use of covered animals, inspect all facilities, and prepare reports of its evaluation. The committee is responsible for reviewing research proposals to determine whether the proposed activities are in accordance with the act. This includes a review of research proposals to determine whether researchers have (1) considered alternatives to procedures that may cause more than momentary or slight pain or distress to covered animals and (2) have provided a written narrative description of the methods and sources they used to determine that alternatives were not available. The committee can ask a researcher to explain why any alternatives found are not used in the researcher\u2019s proposal or withhold approval of the proposal. Facilities that used or intended to use live covered animals in research are to submit a retrospective annual report about those animals to APHIS on or before December 1 of each calendar year. In particular, the annual reports are to include an assurance that each researcher considered alternatives to painful procedures. HHS\u2019s NIH is responsible for establishing guidelines implementing certain provisions of the Health Research Extension Act of 1985. NIH\u2019s responsibilities under the act include reviewing federal and nonfederal research facilities\u2019 vertebrate animal care and use programs to determine whether they meet relevant standards and are thereby eligible to receive funding from HHS agencies covered by the act, including NIH. NIH implements the animal care provisions of the act through its Public Health Service Policy. The policy\u2019s requirements related to research facilities\u2019 consideration of alternatives include the following: Consistent with the act, NIH\u2019s Public Health Service Policy directs facilities to provide for NIH\u2019s approval a document that describes their vertebrate animal care and use program and that provides assurances that the research institution meets applicable standards. Such assurances must include a synopsis of training or instruction in research or testing methods that minimize the number of vertebrate animals required to obtain valid results and minimize animal distress and that the facility offers to scientists, animal technicians, and other personnel involved in animal care, treatment, or use. As a condition of receiving funding for animal research from HHS agencies, facilities must, for the most part, adhere to the eighth edition of the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (Guide). The Guide states that in preparing and reviewing research protocols, researchers and animal care and use committees should consider the availability or appropriateness of using less invasive procedures, other species, isolated organ preparation, cell or tissue culture, or computer simulation. The Guide does not limit this to research that is painful or distressful. NIH conducts site visits at selected research facilities to assess compliance with the act. Whereas the Animal Welfare Act applies to certain warm-blooded animals, the definition of animals used for the purposes of the Health Research Extension Act covers all vertebrates, including the mice, rats, and fish species commonly used in laboratory research. Other laws relevant to the consideration of alternatives include the following: The National Institutes of Health Revitalization Act of 1993 directs the Director of NIH to prepare a plan to conduct or support research into methods of biomedical research and experimentation that do not require the use of animals, that reduce the number of animals used in such research, and that produce less pain and distress in such animals. The act also directs NIH to prepare a plan for establishing the validity and reliability of the new methods it develops, encouraging the scientific community\u2019s acceptance of these methods, and training scientists in using such methods. The act further directs NIH to periodically review this plan and, as appropriate, make revisions and include those revisions in a biennial report. In response to the act, in September 1994 NIH established ICCVAM as an ad hoc committee. The ICCVAM Authorization Act of 2000 directed NIH to establish the ICCVAM as a permanent interagency committee under NIH\u2019s National Toxicology Program Interagency Center for the Evaluation of Alternative Toxicological Methods. ICCVAM is administered by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. The act specifies that ICCVAM be composed of the heads (or their designees) of 15 agencies or subagencies, including EPA, agencies within HHS, and USDA. The National Institutes of Standards and Technology joined voluntarily in 2016. The act directed ICCVAM to, among other things, review and evaluate alternative test methods that may be acceptable for specific regulatory uses and to prepare biennial progress reports. Under the act, an alternative test method is one that reduces the number of animals required; refines procedures to lessen or eliminate pain or distress to animals or enhances animal well-being; or replaces animals with non- animal systems or one animal species with a species presumed to have less ability to feel pain, such as replacing a mammal with an invertebrate. In January 2018, ICCVAM published a strategic roadmap articulating its vision to meet its purpose. The Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act amended the Toxic Substance Control Act in 2016 to include language on the use of alternative methods. The act directs the Administrator of EPA to reduce and replace, to the extent practicable, scientifically justified, and consistent with the policies of the Toxic Substances Control Act, the use of vertebrate animals in the testing of chemical substances or mixtures under the Toxic Substances Control Act. The act also directs the Administrator to develop a strategic plan to promote the development and implementation of alternative test methods and strategies to reduce, refine, or replace vertebrate animal testing. Methods HHS, USDA, and EPA have used to ensure that researchers consider alternatives to animal research include requiring researchers to describe and document their consideration of alternatives. In addition, USDA\u2019s APIHS and HHS\u2019s NIH help ensure that researchers consider alternatives by overseeing research facilities and these facilities\u2019 animal care and use committees, including the committees\u2019 review of animal research protocols. USDA and NIH also provide training to researchers and animal care and use committees to help ensure researchers have considered alternatives. For research that they conduct or fund, component agencies and offices within HHS, USDA, and EPA call for individual researchers to describe their consideration of alternatives to animal research. USDA\u2019s APHIS and HHS\u2019s NIH require research facilities to consider alternatives through the agencies\u2019 implementation of the Animal Welfare Act regulations and Public Health Service Policy, respectively. EPA research is covered by the two laws to the extent that it uses animals covered by the Animal Welfare Act or Health Research Extension Act. Table 3 summarizes the factors that determine whether researchers are required under the acts to consider alternatives. The steps HHS, USDA, and EPA take to help ensure that agency researchers and the researchers that they fund or oversee meet the requirement to consider alternatives include (1) calling for written descriptions of researchers\u2019 consideration of alternatives and (2) prescribing or recommending that researchers use searches, such as of databases of published scientific literature, to identify alternatives. Call for written descriptions. As specified in the Animal Welfare Act regulations and Public Health Service Policy, HHS, USDA, and EPA call for researchers to send written descriptions of research projects involving animals to animal care and use committees for their review and approval. In particular, the Animal Welfare Act regulations require these committees to determine that researchers have provided a written narrative description of the methods and sources they used to determine that alternatives were not available. The Public Health Service Policy requires that researchers\u2019 institutions submit written descriptions of research projects to the committees and for the committees to determine that researchers\u2019 procedures avoid or minimize discomfort, distress, and pain to animals, consistent with sound research design, among other things, and that researchers follow the U.S. Government Principles for the Utilization and Care of Vertebrate Animals Used in Testing, Research, and Training. The principles require the consideration of alternatives. In our review of protocol forms from our sample of 12 research facilities (including HHS, USDA, and EPA facilities), we found that all of the forms requested information on researchers\u2019 consideration of alternatives, though the forms varied in the particular information they requested. The types of information requested included a rationale for involving animals and for the number of animals to be used, assurance that research activities do not unnecessarily duplicate previous experiments, and a description of the methods and sources used to determine that alternatives were not available. Several of the protocol forms required researchers to identify alternatives considered but not adopted. Recommended method for identifying alternatives. In their implementation of the Animal Welfare Act and Health Research Extension Act, respectively, USDA and NIH consider database searches as a best practice for researchers using animals covered by the acts to identify and consider alternatives to animal testing. A database search involves a researcher using keywords related to the planned use of animals to query citations in databases of published scientific literature. From April 1997 through July 2018, USDA maintained a policy, known as Animal Care Policy #12, in its animal care policy manual. In Policy #12, the agency recommended a database search as the most effective and efficient method for demonstrating compliance with the requirement to consider alternatives to painful or distressful procedures. According to USDA\u2019s Deputy Administrator responsible for implementation of the Animal Welfare Act regulations, in July 2018, USDA placed the policy in inoperative status after determining that some research facilities and agency inspectors had misinterpreted the policy as a requirement. Moreover, in response to the 21st Century Cures Act, USDA is reviewing its animal care policy manual, including Policy #12, to ensure the policies in the manual conform with the Animal Welfare Act and its implementing regulations, harmonize with NIH guidance, and reduce researcher burden where possible. According to the Deputy Administrator, as of June 2019, USDA had not decided what, if anything, it would do to revise or replace Policy #12. According to a draft interagency report in response to the 21st Century Cures Act, USDA will make any revised and future policies involving the use of animals available for public comment using regulations.gov or a similar service. However, according to the Deputy Administrator, even though Policy #12 is inoperative, USDA continues to advocate for database searches, particularly through the USDA Animal Welfare Information Center\u2019s provision of information to the scientific community about how to search for alternatives. According to a senior NIH official, NIH requires that agency researchers conduct database searches. Also, in a sample animal study proposal form NIH has provided to animal care and use committees, NIH recommends that researchers at other facilities conduct database searches. Furthermore, 11 of the 12 research facilities we reviewed (including HHS, USDA, and EPA facilities) used research protocol forms that required or recommended that their researchers conduct a database search for alternatives to animal research. Agencies may apply additional requirements to individual researchers at their own facilities or through grants they fund, in addition to applying the requirements of the Animal Welfare Act and Health Research Extension Act. For example, CDC\u2019s Fort Collins, Colorado, facility requires researchers to provide assurance on their protocol forms that the facility\u2019s animal care and use committee\u2019s statistician reviewed the form to determine whether the research would use an appropriate number of animals or explain why a review of the number of animals did not occur. Similarly, the Chairman of APHIS\u2019s National Wildlife Research Center committee told us that its animal care and use committee includes a biostatistician who conducts an analysis to ensure that the numbers of animals to be used will produce statistically significant results. USDA\u2019s National Institute for Food and Agriculture requires applicants for funding from the agency\u2019s Agriculture and Food Research Initiative Competitive Grants Program to use statistical power analysis, when appropriate, to determine the sample sizes of animals to be used in research. USDA officials told us that this type of analysis provides a justification for the number of animals needed to provide valid results and helps prevent the unnecessary use of animals. Agencies may also require information on animal use in proposals submitted by extramural researchers. For example, NIH instructs researchers to describe the use of animals in their work in a section of grant applications, contract proposals, and cooperative agreements. Specifically, when submitting a proposal, researchers must justify to agency officials and other reviewers that the species used is appropriate for the proposed research and explain why research goals cannot be accomplished using an alternative model, such as computational, human, invertebrate, or in vitro models. APHIS and NIH help ensure that researchers consider alternatives through the agencies\u2019 oversight of research facilities and these facilities\u2019 animal care and use committees, including the committees\u2019 review of animal research protocols. In particular, APHIS collects and reviews annual reports from federal and nonfederal research facilities in which the facilities are required to provide an assurance that researchers considered alternatives. The Animal Welfare Act requires APHIS to annually inspect nonfederal research facilities to determine whether the facilities are in compliance with the act. As part of a facility inspection, APHIS inspectors are to examine whether researchers have met the requirement to consider alternatives to any procedure likely to produce pain in or distress to species of animals covered by the act. According to APHIS officials, inspectors examine a sample of approved animal research protocols to check whether the protocol forms include a written narrative on the consideration of alternatives and to ensure that the facility\u2019s animal care and use committee approved the protocol forms. The inspectors may issue citations of noncompliance if they find inadequate documentation that researchers associated with one or more protocols considered alternatives to procedures that may cause more than momentary or slight pain or distress to animals. APHIS provided us with inspection reports for fiscal years 2015 through 2018 in which inspectors issued 57 citations to research facilities for noncompliance with the Animal Welfare Act regulations that require researchers to consider alternatives to animals or issued \u201cteachable moments.\u201d The inspection reports included some citations that, according to APHIS officials, were incorrectly issued because inspectors interpreted the Policy #12 recommendations on database searches as requirements. In addition, NIH\u2019s Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare is responsible for the general administration and coordination of the Public Health Service Policy and provides specific guidance, instruction, and materials to research facilities that receive funding from agencies covered by the act. For all such facilities, NIH is to review the facilities\u2019 assurance documents describing their animal care and use programs. In particular, the Animal Welfare Assurance document is to describe the procedures\u2014including review of animal research protocols\u2014that the animal care and use committees follow to fulfill the directives of the NIH Public Health Service Policy. Further, NIH conducts site visits at a small number of facilities. The Public Health Service Policy states that each awardee institution is subject to review at any time by agency staff and advisors to assess the adequacy and accuracy of the institution\u2019s compliance or expressed compliance with the policy, and this review may include a site visit. According to NIH officials, when agency staff conduct site visits, they examine the facility\u2019s protocol form to confirm that its animal care and use committee requests information from researchers about their consideration of alternatives. NIH officials may also examine a sample of approved protocol forms during a site visit. According to NIH officials, the Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare conducted 38 site visits in fiscal years 2015 through 2018 and found one deficiency related to the consideration of alternatives. USDA and NIH have provided training to researchers and animal care and use committee members on the requirements of the Animal Welfare Act and the Health Research Extension Act. The training has addressed, among other things, the requirement to consider alternatives and has included advice on how to search for alternatives. Through its Animal Welfare Information Center, USDA provides training on how to conduct database searches for alternatives to animal research and assists individual researchers with their literature searches. According to USDA staff, the information center provides three workshops per year on meeting the requirements of the Animal Welfare Act, each lasting a day and a half. The workshops are open to anyone working with animals in research, including scientists, veterinarians, librarians, and animal care and use committee members. The center also gives workshops upon request at specific facilities. Additionally, the center\u2019s website contains resources for conducting literature searches, and, according to a senior information center official, the center plans to put workshops into an online format that will be available upon demand. According to the official, the center conducted 137 database searches upon request in fiscal years 2014 through 2018. NIH has also provided training on the consideration of alternatives to help researchers meet their requirements under the Health Research Extension Act. For example, in 2014 NIH presented a webinar on searches for alternatives. The webinar, titled Meeting Requirements for Alternatives Searches and available on NIH\u2019s website, provides advice on how to conduct database searches. For example, the webinar provided advice on the timing of the search, the search strategy, and particular databases to use. In September 2015, NIH presented a webinar demonstrating how to use NIH\u2019s database of research projects to find researchers, projects, and publications that may help replace, reduce, and refine the use of animals in research. The NIH Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare provides on its website a sample animal study protocol form that emphasizes database searches for any procedures that cause more than momentary or slight pain or distress to the animals. In addition, according to a senior official from the NIH office overseeing the agencies\u2019 intramural research using animals, researchers at NIH must complete an online course regarding animal use every 3 years. The course includes a section on replacing, reducing, and refining animal use and outlines how researchers are to report literature searches in order to show they considered alternatives. EPA, HHS, and USDA have facilitated the development, use, and promotion of alternative research methods through individual and collaborative efforts, including strategies for promoting the use of alternative methods and development of policies and guidance on alternative methods. The three agencies have also developed alternative research methods that rely on non-animal models and procedures to test how various products would affect humans. Additionally, the agencies have worked collaboratively with each other and with nonfederal stakeholders to promote alternative methods, in particular through ICCVAM, which is required to report to the public on its progress. However, ICCVAM and its member agencies have not routinely developed or reported metrics for assessing the effect that their efforts are having on animal use. EPA has issued a strategic plan and FDA has issued a roadmap for the use of methods that may reduce animal use in assessments of the safety and efficacy of various products. Both agencies and others within HHS and USDA have also issued guidance on using alternatives to animal research in particular contexts, such as vaccine testing. In June 2018, EPA\u2019s Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention issued a strategic plan for the reduction of vertebrate animal testing for toxic chemicals regulated under the Toxic Substances Control Act. The office developed and issued this strategic plan to implement a provision in the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act (Lautenberg Act) calling for such a plan. The strategic plan describes a multi-year process with incremental steps for adopting and integrating methods that do not use vertebrate animals in evaluating chemicals regulated by the Toxic Substances Control Act for their effect on human health and the environment. The strategic plan states that the agency\u2019s long-term goal is to reduce and eventually eliminate vertebrate animal testing for chemicals regulated under the act. Pursuant to the strategic plan, in June 2018 EPA published a list of methods the agency had identified that require no vertebrate testing and that are capable of providing information of equivalent or better scientific reliability and quality than that which would be obtained from vertebrate animal testing. According to EPA, the agency plans to update the list at least once a year. EPA\u2019s strategic plan calls for other near-term activities such as retrospectively identifying and evaluating the studies that it has requested and received for both new and existing chemicals. The plan states that EPA will complete this analysis in 2019 and use the results to support the future development of alternative methods to fit the agency\u2019s needs. In May 2011, EPA\u2019s Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention issued a strategic plan in response to a 2007 National Academies report calling for a more efficient and informative risk assessment process to predict and characterize potential human health and environmental hazards from exposures to pesticides. The office\u2019s strategic plan envisions using a combination of computational and predictive modeling approaches, in vitro techniques, and targeted in vivo testing to supplement or replace the existing toxicity tests required in federal regulations for pesticide registration under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act. Pursuant to this strategic plan, EPA\u2019s Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention has issued guidance on data requirements for assessing pesticide safety that may reduce animal use. For example, EPA issued guidance in May 2013 on the data that the agency needs in order to adequately assess pesticide risks. The guidance also provided information to manufacturers on how to request waivers from the data requirements, which would enable the manufacturers to reduce animal use. EPA also issued guidance in November 2016 that allows pesticide manufacturers to request a waiver from the requirement to provide data on acute toxicity tests and that contains a policy statement waiving all acute lethality dermal studies for formulated pesticide products; such waivers can reduce the need for pesticide manufacturers to conduct tests using animals. For example, EPA reported granting a total of 223 waivers in fiscal years 2016 and 2017, pursuant to the agency\u2019s May 2013 guidance for toxicity studies, which the agency estimated avoided the use of 85,000 animals and saved pesticide manufacturers $26.4 million in conducting toxicity studies. In February 2016, EPA announced an effort to evaluate and implement alternative methods for tests involving acute oral, dermal, and inhalation toxicity; skin and eye irritation; and skin sensitization. As part of this effort, in April 2018, EPA issued a draft policy to reduce the use of animals in testing chemicals to evaluate whether they cause an allergic reaction, inflammation, or sensitization of the skin. EPA\u2019s policy describes conditions under which the Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention will accept alternative approaches to laboratory animal studies for identifying skin sensitization hazards. In December 2017, in response to direction from the FDA Commissioner, FDA developed a roadmap to foster the development and evaluation of emerging tools and methods that can improve toxicology methods for assessing the safety of FDA-regulated products. The roadmap does not have an explicit goal to replace, reduce, or refine animal testing but states that new methods may have the potential to do so. In that regard, the roadmap states that FDA will encourage medical product sponsors to submit a scientifically valid approach for using a new method early in the regulatory process and to engage in frequent communication with the agency about the suitability of that method. In addition, the roadmap recommended that FDA establish an organizing committee; conduct training; foster communication and collaboration with stakeholders, such as industry and academia; engage in research; and track and report annually on its progress. In June 2019, FDA posted its first annual report on its progress in implementing the roadmap. Previously, FDA had taken steps to reduce animal use by issuing guidance to members of industry seeking approval for FDA-regulated products. In general, FDA guidance states that industry may choose to use an approach\u2014such as a non-animal testing method\u2014other than one set forth in guidance as long as it complies with relevant statutes and regulations. FDA has also taken more specific steps to modify guidance to promote the use of alternative methods. For example, in 2012, FDA issued guidance to industry that states that firms may use non-animal alternative methods to test the toxicological safety of pharmaceutical drugs if the methods are appropriate or scientifically justified. In 2013, FDA issued guidance that, among other things, allowed industry to use in vitro assays rather than mice to detect toxins in shellfish meant for human consumption; this guidance subsequently played a role in the adoption of additional methods that do not employ animal use. Other HHS and USDA agencies within our scope do not have strategic plans or roadmaps that promote a comprehensive strategy for alternative research methods, but some of the agencies have issued guidance to their own researchers or to regulated entities that may reduce animal use. For example, in 2017, APHIS updated its guidance to allow manufacturers of animal vaccines, inactivated bacterial products, and antibody products to request an exemption to animal safety testing if the products have a documented history of acceptable safety results and controlled manufacturing processes that ensure batch consistency and sterility. APHIS also issued a notice in 2017 of a testing option that can reduce by up to 50 percent the number of hamsters required for potency testing of vaccines for the bacterial disease leptospirosis, according to the notice. In addition, APHIS issued memorandums in 2013 and 2015 that provide guidance on in vitro techniques that researchers may use instead of animals to test the potency of vaccines. Some agencies have also adopted alternative methods for their researchers without issuing specific guidance to do so. For example, in September 2018, CDC began routine use of an in vitro procedure developed by the agency that allows its laboratories to test for botulism in human serum specimens without using mice. CDC officials stated that this method is fast and inexpensive and would reduce the need for hundreds of mice. CDC officials told us that their researchers plan to expand use of the in vitro procedure to test other types of specimens, further reducing the use of animals. HHS, USDA, and EPA have made multiple efforts to develop alternative research methods that, according to the agencies, have reduced animal use or have the potential to do so. Some of these efforts target reducing the use of animals in a particular research context while others have broader applications in toxicology and computer modeling. In some cases, agency officials provided estimates of how their targeted efforts have reduced or may reduce animal use. Examples of targeted efforts include the following: CDC researchers told us they have evaluated a method that reduces the number of animals and time needed to produce kits that are distributed worldwide to identify influenza virus subtypes and thereby aid in strain selection for the influenza vaccine each season. Under the original method, antibodies for the kits were generated from blood samples in sheep that were later euthanized. The CDC researchers concluded that an alternative automated method that draws antibody-rich plasma from goats instead of blood from sheep could reduce the time needed to produce the kits and require fewer animals. According to FDA officials, FDA is collaborating with others on the development of an in vitro assay that will be used to test the potency of human rabies vaccines that manufacturers submit to FDA for approval. This new method will replace the animal-based assay that is part of the current license to manufacture rabies vaccine. The officials said that the animal-based assay uses 600 mice, on average, for each batch of vaccine submitted by a manufacturer. According to an ARS research paper, ARS worked with academic researchers to develop an in vitro method for feeding blood to ticks. According to ARS officials, the method allows researchers to reduce the number of animals used when studying disease transmission in animals via tick-borne pathogens. APHIS currently holds federal pesticide registrations with EPA for active ingredients formulated into end-use products, such as rodenticides, that APHIS uses to prevent damage to agriculture, endangered species, or critical habitats. According to APHIS officials, the agency uses an EPA- approved method for testing the risks to human health from new pesticide products that substantially reduces animal use. The method generally involves progressively increasing the pesticide dose on a relatively small number of animals compared to the previous method and waiting to observe whether the dose causes mortality before deciding whether to increase the dose in further testing. APHIS officials said the new method reduces animal use by 50 percent or more per test. EPA\u2019s Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program Uses Alternatives to Animals Led by its Office of Science Coordination and Policy, EPA established the Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program in 1998 to fulfill a congressional mandate in the 1996 Food Quality Protection Act to develop a program to screen for certain chemicals (e.g., pesticides) that affect human hormones. EPA expanded the scope of the program to include screening the effects of chemicals on the human thyroid system and wildlife. The program began using automated, large-scale screening methods and computational models to evaluate and screen chemicals and, according to EPA, allows EPA to screen more chemicals in less time, use fewer animals, and reduce cost. Agencies\u2019 broader efforts include the integration of advances in biology, chemistry, and computer science into areas of research, such as toxicology, that currently rely heavily on animal use. For example, EPA launched the Toxicity Forecaster in 2007 as an effort to use automated technologies to expose living cells or isolated proteins to chemicals and screen the cells or proteins when exposed to chemicals for changes in biological activity that suggest potential toxic effects. According to EPA documents, these methods could limit the number of required laboratory animal-based toxicity tests while quickly and efficiently screening large numbers of chemicals. According to EPA documents, in the first phase of this effort, which the agency completed in 2009, EPA evaluated more than 300 well-studied chemicals (primarily pesticides) that had extensive data from traditional animal-based toxicity testing; the agency then compared results from automated screening technologies with the results from the traditional animal tests. As of 2018, EPA had developed and made publicly available a library of toxicity data on more than 4,500 chemicals. The availability of the Toxicity Forecaster data has enabled EPA to reduce the need for animal testing in its Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program for identifying chemicals that may affect human hormone systems (see sidebar). Similarly, FDA has initiated a broad effort to incorporate greater use of computer modeling and simulation into its decision-making on FDA- regulated products. For example, FDA formed an agency working group on modeling and simulation in 2017. According to the Chair of the working group, it does not have an explicit objective to reduce animal testing, but such reduction is a potential benefit of the testing approaches the group is advancing. For example, the Chair said that modeling and simulation can help refine questions about products submitted for FDA approval and therefore could reduce the number of animal studies needed before clinical trials. EPA and NIH have provided funding to extramural researchers to develop alternative research methods. For example, from 2013 through 2018, EPA provided $24 million in funding for research on 3-D models containing human cells (these devices are also known as tissue chips) that can be used for tests that otherwise might be conducted using animals. In 2018, EPA also announced $4.25 million in funding for research to promote the development and use of alternative methods that reduce, refine, or replace vertebrate animal use for toxicity testing. Similarly, in 2017, NIH awarded a $962,000 grant to a research facility to conduct studies of an in vitro human bronchial tissue model for predicting the toxicity of inhaled chemicals. Additionally, while USDA\u2019s National Institute for Food and Agriculture did not set aside a specific amount of funding, in May 2019 the agency made clear to applicants for its Welfare and Well-being of Agricultural Animals grant program that proposals that study ways to reduce the need for animals in research are eligible for funding in fiscal years 2019 and 2020. HHS, USDA, and EPA have joined partnerships to develop, use, and promote alternative testing methods. For example, the agencies participate in ICCVAM, which states that its mission is to facilitate the development, validation, and regulatory acceptance of test methods that replace, reduce, or refine the use of animals. ICCVAM itself does not conduct research or validation studies on alternative methods. Instead, it relies on stakeholders including federal agencies that generate, require, or use toxicological data; companies that develop toxicological tests; and animal welfare organizations. According to committee guidelines, stakeholders can submit the results of their research to ICCVAM, and the committee then conducts evaluations and makes recommendations on submissions for regulatory uses that align with the needs and priorities of member agencies. Zebrafish Are Used as Alternatives to Other Animals in Research A zebrafish is a freshwater, tropical vertebrate fish that is widely used in pharmaceutical development and medical and scientific research due to certain qualities of its morphology and development as well as its inexpensive cost to use and maintain. Some of these qualities include genetic and structural similarities to other vertebrates that mimic human responses to certain genes involved in human diseases and its transparent embryonic development that enables researchers to use it as an alternative model for toxicity screening of drugs and chemicals. These qualities have led to the use of zebrafish embryonic models for automated, large-scale screening programs by the National Toxicology Program and the Environmental Protection Agency, among others. ICCVAM\u2019s website contains information on current ICCVAM- recommended protocols for specific test methods, such as methods to test for eye corrosion and irritation and skin sensitization, and on events organized by NIH and others that are relevant to the replacement, reduction, or refinement of animal use in research. For example, the website has a link to a page on NIH\u2019s website that has the slide presentations given at six webinars from 2017 through 2018 on the use of zebrafish in toxicology testing. Researchers may use zebrafish and their embryos in particular as a replacement for other animals, such as mice (see sidebar). ICCVAM maintains on its website a list of 108 alternative methods that, as of June 2019, had been accepted by one or more federal agencies. These include methods that ICCVAM and its member agencies contributed to developing or validating. However, according to ICCVAM\u2019s strategic roadmap issued in January 2018, the committee concluded that its evaluations of new methods during its first 15 years were lengthy, inefficient, and resource intensive. ICCVAM concluded that researchers and test method developers often initiated the development of alternative methods with little input from federal agencies or regulated industries and, therefore, these methods did not always meet the needs of federal agencies. Consequently, these methods were either not accepted by federal agencies or were accepted by the agencies but not used by the regulated community. Recognizing these limitations, ICCVAM initiated a strategic shift in 2013 aimed at adjusting the validation of new test methods to be more responsive to the needs of federal agencies and other stakeholders. Accordingly, ICCVAM\u2019s 2018 strategic roadmap set new objectives for reducing animal use, including the following: Connect the developers of alternative methods with the regulatory agencies and the regulated industries that would ultimately use the new technologies to increase the likelihood of the methods being successfully developed and implemented. Foster the use of efficient and flexible practices, such as public-private partnerships to promote communication and cooperation, to establish confidence in new methods. Encourage the adoption and use of new methods and approaches by federal agencies and regulated industries, such as through training programs on the use of new methods. ICCVAM has established workgroups to develop detailed implementation plans to address roadmap goals. According to the strategic roadmap, the implementation plans will include four key elements: (1) definition of testing needs; (2) identification of any available alternative tests and computer models; (3) a plan to develop integrated approaches to testing and assessment and defined approaches for interpreting data; and (4) a plan to address both scientific and nonscientific challenges, including regulatory challenges, such as international harmonization. As of June 2019, workgroups on acute systemic toxicity, eye and skin irritation, and skin sensitization had posted information concerning these elements on ICCVAM\u2019s website. For example, each workgroup authored an article published in a peer-reviewed journal and posted on the ICCVAM website about the testing needs of regulatory agencies and information about available alternatives. Another interagency effort that has a goal of promoting the use of alternative methods is the Toxicology in the 21st Century (Tox21) Program. Formed in 2008, the program is a collaborative effort among NIH, FDA, and EPA to characterize the potential toxicity of chemicals by using cells and isolated molecular targets instead of laboratory animals. A central component of the program is its focus on developing and evaluating automated in vitro screening methods to assess the hazards of chemical substances. As of February 2018, the program had used this method to assess approximately 10,000 chemicals for their potential impacts on biological systems. According to NIH\u2019s Tox21 website, these automated methods have yielded high-quality toxicity data on environmental substances in a fraction of the time that would have been required with traditional animal testing. To address key challenges in toxicology testing, the program\u2019s federal partners developed a strategic and operational plan in March 2018 that expanded the focus of Tox21\u2019s research activities to include developing alternative test systems that predict chemical toxicity in humans and addressing the technical limitations of and strengthening scientific confidence in current in vitro test systems. According to NIH, activities under the plan will lead to better predicting chemical toxicity to humans through using non-animal alternatives such as stem cells and computational models. Since 2011, federal agencies have also collaborated to develop devices containing human cells that can be used for tests that otherwise might be conducted using animals. See figure 1 for an example of such devices, known as tissue chips or human microphysiological systems. According to NIH officials, this evolving technology may reduce animal testing and produce results more relevant to human health. The interagency effort was initiated in September 2011 when the President announced the formation of a collaborative project between NIH, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and FDA to develop tissue chips loaded with living human cells to screen the efficacy, safety, and toxicity of drugs, vaccines, or biological products for humans. Subsequently, in July 2012, NIH launched the Tissue Chip for Drug Screening program, which provided 19 grants to research facilities to develop tissue chips that accurately model the structure and function of the human lung, liver, heart, and more. In September 2014, NIH announced a second phase of the program in which researchers would refine existing tissue chips and combine them into an integrated system that can mimic the complex functions of the human body. In one example of this collaboration, two project teams funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency\u2014the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Wyss Institute at Harvard University\u2014are working with NIH-funded researchers to develop platforms that integrate 10 tissue chips that each represent a separate human organ. Federal agencies have also collaborated with nongovernmental organizations on training to promote the use of alternative methods. For example, NIH and the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) International Science Consortium offered a webinar series from March through September 2016 on alternative approaches for assessing acute inhalation toxicity. Webinar presenters described alternative approaches for identifying substances likely to cause acute systemic toxicity through inhalation. Similarly, EPA collaborated with the PETA International Science Consortium and the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine on webinars in November 2018, February 2019, and April 2019 that addressed alternative methods for testing the effect of chemicals on skin, for predicting the effect of inhaled substances, and for identifying substances that cause irritation or inflammation in human respiratory systems. ICCVAM\u2019s strategic roadmap calls for its members to identify appropriate metrics for prioritizing activities, monitoring progress, and measuring success toward the goals described in the roadmap. However, ICCVAM and its member agencies have not routinely developed metrics that they could report to the public to demonstrate how their individual or collective efforts to encourage the use of alternative methods have affected or will affect animal use. HHS, USDA, and EPA officials, as well as ICCVAM\u2019s roadmap, have cited challenges to measuring the results of ICCVAM and its member agencies\u2019 efforts. For example, according to agency officials, differences in the regulatory contexts in which agencies use data generated through animal research\u2014for example, in regulation of pesticides versus human or animal drugs\u2014limit agencies\u2019 ability to develop metrics that can be applied across multiple agencies. Furthermore, the ICCVAM roadmap states that measuring the actual impact of encouraging the adoption and use of new methods is difficult in the United States due to the limited ability to quantify animals used for toxicity testing. In particular, the Animal Welfare Act does not cover several species commonly used in research, including mice, rats, and birds bred for research and cold-blooded species such as fish. Therefore, research facilities are not required under the act to report their use of those species to APHIS, and the data APHIS receives from research facilities can only be used to track a subset of the total number of animals used for research in the United States. Although ICCVAM and its member agencies face challenges in developing metrics, the roadmap also states that agency-specific mechanisms to measure progress may exist, such as tracking the number of waivers granted for a particular animal test. For example, as discussed above, EPA has estimated the extent to which its granting of data waivers to pesticide manufacturers has reduced animal use and research costs. Additionally, some agencies have estimated the effect that a new alternative method could have on animal use. Moreover, officials from FDA and EPA said that their agencies are able to accept non-animal test data in lieu of animal test data if the data meet their regulatory needs. Measuring the frequency with which the agencies receive non-animal test data instead of animal data could be another mechanism for estimating changes in animal use. In addition, the ICCVAM Authorization Act of 2000 requires ICCVAM to prepare biennial public reports on its progress under the act\u2014including its efforts to ensure that new and revised test methods are validated to meet the needs of federal agencies and to reduce, refine, or replace the use of animals in testing, among other things. ICCVAM, with support from NIH\u2019s National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, has issued the required biennial progress reports since 2001, including the most recent report issued in July 2018 that covers 2016 and 2017. However, the committee\u2019s biennial progress reports, including the July 2018 report, provide few quantitative or qualitative assessments of the progress the member agencies have made, individually or collectively, toward reducing, refining, or replacing animal use in testing. ICCVAM\u2019s strategic roadmap states that it envisions that workgroups will play a key role in implementing the goals of the strategic roadmap, but ICCVAM has not designated a workgroup to address the challenges related to metrics, similar to other workgroups that the committee has established to address the roadmap\u2019s goals. According to officials from NIH\u2019s National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, which manages the committee, the strategic roadmap is a work in progress and developing metrics is the third of three roadmap goals. The ICCVAM Authorization Act of 2000 does not provide the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences with authority to direct agencies to develop and report metrics. However, agency officials agreed that ICCVAM could facilitate the establishment or designation of a workgroup of member agencies to identify a range of potential quantitative and qualitative metrics that member agencies could use to assess their progress toward reducing, refining, or replacing animal use. By establishing or designating such a workgroup to develop metrics that the agencies could use to assess their individual or collective progress toward reducing, refining, or replacing animal use in testing and by incorporating those metrics in ICCVAM\u2019s biennial progress reports, ICCVAM and its member agencies could better monitor progress across the range of the committee\u2019s efforts and report the members\u2019 progress to the public. HHS, USDA, and EPA use a variety of methods to ensure that researchers\u2014whether employed by or receiving research funding from these agencies\u2014consider alternative methods to animal research. The agencies also have engaged in multiple efforts to expand the range of available alternatives. Under one of these efforts, ICCVAM\u2019s strategic roadmap calls for its members to identify appropriate metrics for prioritizing activities, monitoring progress, and measuring success. The roadmap envisions that workgroups will play a key role in implementing the goals of the strategic roadmap. However, ICCVAM has not designated a workgroup to address the challenges related to developing and reporting metrics. In addition, ICCVAM has issued the required biennial progress reports since 2001, but the reports provide few quantitative or qualitative assessments of the progress member agencies have made, individually or collectively, toward reducing, refining, or replacing animal use in testing. By establishing or designating a workgroup to develop metrics to assess the progress member agencies have made, individually or collectively, toward reducing, refining, or replacing animal use in testing and by incorporating those metrics in ICCVAM\u2019s biennial progress reports, ICCVAM and its member agencies could better monitor progress across the range of the committee\u2019s efforts and report the members\u2019 progress to the public. The Director of the NIH\u2019s National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences should (1) facilitate the establishment or designation of a workgroup of representatives of ICCVAM member agencies to develop metrics that the agencies could use to assess the progress they have individually or collectively made toward reducing, refining, or replacing animal use in testing and (2) incorporate those metrics into the committee\u2019s biennial progress reports. (Recommendation 1) We provided a draft of this report to HHS, USDA, and EPA. HHS provided written comments on the draft, which are presented in appendix I. In its written comments, HHS stated that NIH concurred with our recommendation. NIH further commented that ICCVAM\u2019s activities in support of promoting alternatives for animal use in testing do not extend to animal use in any other context, such as research or training. NIH explained that our use of the terms research and researcher to refer more generally to research, testing, teaching, or experimentation could cause misunderstanding. We understand that ICCVAM\u2019s activities are focused on animal use in product testing. In addition, we intended our recommendation that the Director of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences facilitate the establishment or designation of an ICCVAM workgroup to be focused on product testing rather than on other types of animal research. However, for editorial reasons, we did not modify our report\u2019s use of the terms research or researcher. HHS and EPA also provided technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate. Among those comments, HHS\u2019s FDA officials stated that the agency encourages the use of alternatives to animal testing and supports the principles of replacement, reduction, and refinement, but if no alternative exists, animal testing may be the most appropriate way to meet certain regulatory requirements to ensure the safety and efficacy of medical products. In its technical comments, EPA cited a September 2019, memorandum EPA\u2019s Administrator issued after we sent our draft report to the agencies for comment. The memorandum commits the agency to take several steps to reduce, replace, and refine animal testing requirements. For example, the Administrator committed EPA to reducing its requests for, and funding of, whole and live mammal studies by 30 percent by 2025 and eliminating all mammal study requests by 2035. We acknowledge EPA\u2019s announcement but did not assess it in our review of federal efforts to facilitate the use of alternative research methods. We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional committees, the Secretary of Agriculture, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, and other interested parties. In addition, the report will be available at no charge on the GAO website at http://www.gao.gov.

HHS and USDA also oversee federal and nonfederal research facilities including researchers' consideration of alternatives to animal use. GAO was asked to review issues related to alternatives to animal research. This report (1) describes how HHS, USDA, and EPA ensure researchers consider the use of alternatives to animals and (2) examines the steps the agencies have taken to facilitate the use of alternative research methods and to assess the effect of their efforts on animal use. GAO reviewed documents, such as agency policies and practices relevant to the consideration of alternatives and interviewed agency officials. GAO also interviewed representatives of a nongeneralizable sample of 12 federal and nonfederal research facilities randomly selected across agencies and facilities. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) use a variety of methods to ensure researchers consider alternatives to animal use in research (see figure). Two of these methods are (1) requiring researchers to obtain approval of their research protocols, including their consideration of alternatives, from their institutions, and (2) calling for or recommending researchers to use database searches to identify alternatives. HHS and USDA also help ensure that researchers consider alternatives through the agencies' oversight of research facilities. For example, USDA is to conduct annual inspections of nonfederal research facilities. Futhermore, the agencies have provided training to researchers on the consideration of alternatives. HHS, USDA, and EPA have facilitated the development and use of alternatives to animal use in research through individual and collaborative efforts. These efforts include agency strategies and policies for promoting the use of alternative methods and the development of testing methods that rely on non-animal models. Additionally, the agencies are members of the Interagency Coordinating Committee on the Validation of Alternative Methods, which is managed by HHS's National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. The committee promotes testing methods that protect human health and the environment while reducing animal use. The interagency committee's 2018 strategic roadmap calls for it to identify appropriate metrics for monitoring progress and measuring success in adopting alternatives. However, the committee and its member agencies have not routinely developed or reported metrics that demonstrate how their efforts to encourage the use of alternative methods affect animal use. They have also not designated an interagency workgroup to address the challenges related to developing and reporting such metrics. Facilitating the establishment of such a workgroup would help the committee and its member agencies better monitor their progress across the range of their efforts to reduce animal use and report members' progress to the public. GAO recommends that HHS's National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences facilitate the establishment of an interagency workgroup to develop metrics for assessing progress on the development and promotion of alternatives to animal use and incorporate those metrics into public reports. HHS agreed with our recommendation.",

    "document": "ROMANS: British Prime Minister David Cameron making an 11th hour push for a no vote on Scottish independence. Cameron made an emotional plea, telling voters in Scotland that the United Kingdom is not just, quote, \"any old country.\" He said millions would be heart broken if the country were broken up. Meantime, word that British banks have been moving billions of bank notes to Scotland. They have to make sure there's enough currency is there if there is a run on ATMs following a yes vote. CNN's Max Foster is live in Edinburgh with the very latest here. Max, when I talk to economists, they say it would be a national economic tragedy for Scotland to secede. But there is this nationalist passion that's keeping the polls pretty balanced.</s>MAX FOSTER, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It's true and you talk about the banks notes coming up, but also a major Scottish bank rolling back in Scotland, one of the biggest in the world, based in Scotland, has contingency plans to move to England if there is a yes vote, because they know it will hit their credit rating. If they are based in the country where no one knows where the control lies, because if it's a yes vote on Thursday, the foreign minister then has to go to negotiations with the Westminster government and talk about how to carve the country up, which is the third of the country's land mass. I mean, what part of the military do we control? What about the pounds? David Cameron being clear that Scotland won't be able to share the pounds. Alex Simon said we will have the pound. We can take the pound. But there would be a Central Bank in Scotland. So many complicated questions. It is making the markets nervous, indeed. But the Westminster government hasn't really helped things, that the treasury has not thought this through. I think actually until a month ago, they did not in the slightest sense there would be yes votes. They weren't prepared for this and this is being factored into the market. So, I think there is a great deal of concern if there is a yes vote. But as you say, this is a passion in Scotland, particularly among the yes campaign. They want to feel like they live in more of a nation where more decisions are made here in Edinburgh -- Christine.</s>ROMANS: It just fascinating. And people as young as 16 are able to vote. So, it is a really interesting development. I'm sure we will talk to you about it a lot over the next couple of days. Max Foster, thanks, Max.</s>BERMAN: I think the implications are huge. What do you say to the separatists in Spain? What do you say to the people in Ukraine right now? You say Scotland split up, why shouldn't we? All right. Happening right now: new U.S. air strikes dropping bombs near Baghdad for the first time as the United States enters a new phase in the battle against ISIS.

Happening now...</s>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I bit into it and I -- I felt this real jab in the top of my mouth.</s>BLITZER: Delta and the FBI now investigating needles -- yes, needles -- found in airline meals. Also, parts of the United States suffering through the worst drought in decades. Farmers are facing ruin. All of us face higher prices at the same time. And a series of highly unusual moves has the world wondering, is North Korea on the brink of any significant change? We want to welcome our viewers in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in THE SITUATION ROOM.</s>BLITZER: We begin this hour in Syria and the intense shelling in the city of Homs. Syrian opposition groups are reporting at least 45 people killed today in violence across the country. That's on top of 97 people killed yesterday, more than 15,000 since last March -- many simply massacred by government forces away from the eyes of the world. Some activists are risking their lives to bear witness. CNN's Arwa Damon has an exclusive report. But we have to warn you, some of the images are very disturbing.</s>ARWA DAMON, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  (voice-over): The power is out in the streets of Duma. The three activists and their escorts don't dare shine the light. There is a sniper lurking. Gunfire in the distance forces them to pick up the pace. The activists are part of the opposition's media operation. They smuggled themselves into the Damascus suburb last month and risked their lives to document this -- a massacre said to have taken place just hours earlier. Among the corpses strewn about, that little girl. A man points to one of the bodies and says, \"He was executed, a civilian.\" He points to a second corpse and adds, \"This is his cousin, shot because he tried to save him.\" Residents are readying the bodies for burial. Blood is soaking through the funeral sheets, the names of the deceased hastily scrawled. It's a grim routine Syrians in areas that have dared stand up to the regime have grown accustomed to. The bodies unceremoniously dragged away and placed alongside others. Residents say Syrian security forces searching for weapons in some buildings wiped out members of several families. This man described what happened in one instance. \"They had two rooms they put the men and the women in,\" he says. \"from 10:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. the living were trapped with the dead. It was an execution. They asked, 'Where are the guns?' 'There are no guns was the response.' And they executed them one after the other.\" At least 45 were killed in this one attack, residents say, information CNN cannot independently verify. In the morning, the media team picked their way through rubble strewn streets, but they would not be able to leave Duma. The Assad regime siege intensified, the government bombardment relentless. Many more were killed. (on camera): The team that filmed this at the end of June was trapped inside Duma for more than a week. And it's taken this long to get the footage smuggled to Lebanon. (voice-over): All of that effort, all of that risk to give to the world a glimpse of Syria's narrative of horror and despair. Arwa Damon, CNN, Beirut.</s>BLITZER: The report, Arwa Damon reporting for us. Here in the United States, the mudslinging between the Romney and Obama campaigns is reaching new levels today, with the campaigns engaged in all-out verbal warfare. CNN's national political correspondent, Jim Acosta, is here in THE SITUATION ROOM. He's got details. And it's getting nasty by the minute -- nastier by the minute, I should say.</s>JIM ACOSTA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Wolf, it is getting rough out there. As we said all day long today, Mitt Romney has been warning the Obama campaign that he would respond to the attacks he's been receiving from the president and his surrogates over the last several days. Today, he and his campaign did just that.</s>ACOSTA (voice-over): In Mitt Romney's first public rally since he says the Obama campaign accused him of committing a crime, the GOP contender blamed the war of words on the president.</s>MITT ROMNEY (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: So the president is looking around for someone to blame. And recently, I became the -- the reason for all our problems here. It was a surprise to my family and me, but he's always looking for someone out there.</s>ACOSTA: Romney says there's a reason for the attacks on his tenure at his former private investment firm, Bain Capital.</s>ROMNEY: I'm convinced he wants Americas to be -- Americans to be ashamed of success.</s>ACOSTA: Not so, says the Obama campaign. At a fundraiser in San Antonio, the president said it's Romney who made his business career fair game.</s>BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: His main calling card for wanting to be president is his private sector experience.</s>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Tax havens.</s>ACOSTA: His campaign is stepping up the attacks, releasing a new ad that asks what Romney is hiding by refusing to release more than two years of tax returns. Romney told the National Review online, \"I'm simply not enthusiastic about giving them hundreds or thousands of more pages to pick through, distort and lie about.\"</s>JOHN SUNUNU, NEW HAMPSHIRE GOVERNOR AND ROMNEY NATIONAL CAMPAIGN CO- CHAIR: They are clearly and unequivocally a bunch of liars.</s>ACOSTA: Punching back, the Romney campaign held a conference call with reporters featuring its brass knuckles surrogate, John Sununu, who questioned the president's understanding of the economy in a personal way.</s>SUNUNU: It is the American way. And I wish this president would learn how to be an American.</s>ACOSTA: Minutes later, Sununu corrected himself.</s>SUNUNU: The president has to learn the American formula for creating business.</s>ROMNEY: Thank you.</s>ACOSTA: But an Ohio businessman on the same call also let loose.</s>KYLE KOEHLER, VICE PRESIDENT, K.K.  TOOL COMPANY: It seems to me that the Obama's America, there's no risk, but there's plenty of reward. That's called socialism to me.</s>ACOSTA: The personal attacks come one day after Romney said he would hit back at the president after what was said on an Obama campaign conference call last week.</s>STEPHANIE CUTTER, OBAMA DEPUTY CAMPAIGN MANAGER: Either Mitt Romney, through his own words and his own signature, was misrepresenting his position at Bain to the SEC, which is a felony, or he was misrepresenting his position at Bain to the American people.</s>ACOSTA: As for the Romney conference call, an Obama campaign spokesman said it's the GOP contender's team that has officially gone off the deep end.</s>ACOSTA: All week there's been speculation Romney might change the subject by naming his running mate. His campaign announced two new staffers for the eventual VP pick. Romney heads to Ohio tomorrow, the home state of the man said to be at the top of the list, Rob Portman. But hold onto your hats. Bobby Jindal also scheduled to be in the same state of Ohio tomorrow -- Wolf.</s>BLITZER: All right. We'll see if there's an announcement or not. See you then.</s>ACOSTA: We'll -- we'll see.</s>BLITZER: If it's not tomorrow, it will be one of these days.</s>ACOSTA: It's got to be one or the other, that's right.</s>BLITZER: Jim Acosta, thanks very much.</s>WOLF BLITZER, HOST: And as Jim just reported, Romney national campaign co-chairman, John Sununu, is getting blasted by Democrats for what they see as some over the line remarks. Today. John Sununu, the former governor of New Hampshire, is joining us on the phone now from Manchester. Governor, thanks very much for coming in. And I want -- I want to give you a full chance to respond to what you said today...</s>SUNUNU: Sure.</s>BLITZER: -- because, as you know, it's causing a huge uproar. Here's the full context of what you said on that conference call with the reporters.</s>SUNUNU: The president clearly demonstrated that he has absolutely no idea how the American econ -- economy functions. The men and women all over America who -- who have worked hard to build these businesses, their businesses, from the ground up is how our economy became the envy of the world. It is the American way. And I wish this president would learn how to be an American.</s>BLITZER: All right, \"I wish this president would learn how to be an American.\" Governor, go ahead and explain what you really -- Sununu: Sure.</s>BLITZER: -- meant to say.</s>SUNUNU: Well, I said the -- first of all, I was responding to the president's really terrible remarks in Virginia over the weekend, where he told the businesspeople of America they shouldn't take credit for building their businesses. That clearly is insulting to them and -- and, in my opinion, expresses a lack of understanding of how jobs are created. I was making the point that in America, entrepreneurs deserve credit and there is an American formula for creating jobs. And I used that phrase three or four times in that call. And -- and I wanted to come back to that same theme in that riff that you just played there. And instead of saying that he's got to learn the American formula for creating jobs, I -- I did say those words that are there. And, frankly, I made a mistake. I shouldn't have used those words. And I apologize for using those words. But I don't apologize for the idea that this president has demonstrated that he does not understand how jobs are created in America. He thinks that jobs are created by giving grants to your cronies, to your bundlers and your contributors, like he did with Solyndra. Like he did with Vista (ph), like he did with the wind projects that took jobs out of this country. The common denominator is that they all had owners and investors that were bundlers and contributors to his campaign. That's what he means, perhaps, when he says government creates jobs, American taxpayer dollars going to cronies.</s>BLITZER: So when you -- hewn you say you were apologizing, are you apologizing directly to the president?</s>SUNUNU: Yes, I'm apologizing for using those words. I shouldn't have used them.</s>BLITZER: All right. Because later in the day, on Fox News -- and I'll put it up on the screen -- you also went on and said this. You said, \"President Obama has no idea how the American system functions and we shouldn't be surprised about that, because he spent his early years in Hawaii smoking something, spent the next set of years in Indonesia.</s>SUNUNU: Yes</s>BLITZER: A lot of people will hear that and think that's pretty outrageous, as well, Governor.</s>SUNUNU: Well, Wolf, look, the president has to stop denigrating American values. He makes success a -- a terrible trait. He's sending the wrong message to the young people of America, that if you get rich, you're somehow evil. Those are issues that are really critical. And -- and the American dream and the in -- inspiration for the American dream comes from participating. And -- and the president, whether he likes to admit it or not, never really held a private sector job in which he earned a real paycheck. And -- and it's a lack of understanding what entrepreneurs do that is creating bad policy out of the White House. And if we don't talk about the fact that he doesn't understand what entrepreneurs do, then we will never understand why he failed to create a single job while he was president.</s>BLITZER: Well, and I guess in the past couple of years, what, about four million jobs have been created.</s>SUNUNU: Yes. Now...</s>BLITZER: A...</s>SUNUNU: -- now he's only 500,000 short total. And, frankly, he's bragging about creating 80,000 last month when -- when to keep up with population growth, you have to have 180,000 to 200,000.</s>BLITZER: But you remember, Governor...</s>SUNUNU: He's...</s>BLITZER: -- you remember, Governor, that when -- in the final months of President Bush's administration, the U.S. Economy was losing 600,000, 700,000, 800,000 jobs a month.</s>SUNUNU: And what you should have is a, in the recovering phase of -- of an economy, as we are supposedly in now, is the mirror image of that. We should be creating 600,000 to 800,000 jobs a month. And he's not.</s>BLITZER: But when -- when the U.S. Was losing all of those jobs, we -- was President Bush un-American? Did he not know anything about the -- the free market system? What was going on?</s>SUNUNU: I think what happened to President Bush is that the -- the explosion of purchases of homes by people who couldn't afford them created a crisis. But that doesn't excuse you from not putting policies in that create jobs. That doesn't excuse from</s>BLITZER: Well, let me just...</s>SUNUNU: -- he's scaring investment.</s>BLITZER: Well, on that point...</s>BLITZER: -- on that same conference call, Governor. There was a businessman, a supporter of Mitt Romney, who flatly said this president was somewhat engaging in socialism. Is that what you're saying, as well?</s>SUNUNU: Well, that's what this president has done. He's created a feeling amongst entrepreneurs that he is not a capitalist. And -- and so I can't -- I can't speak for every businessperson out there in which that feeling has been engendered. But the president should be aware of the fact that small businesspeople -- listen to what the NFID said about this president. Small people -- small businesspeople think this president has absolutely no idea what to do to ce -- to create an environment for them to start hiring.</s>BLITZER: But are you saying...</s>SUNUNU: He's...</s>BLITZER: -- he's a socialist?</s>SUNUNU: No, I didn't say he was a socialist.</s>BLITZER: All right. All right. I just was wondering, because we...</s>SUNUNU: I didn't say that.</s>BLITZER: -- we did hear that...</s>SUNUNU: Don't -- don't...</s>BLITZER: -- from that -- I'm -- I just asked if you were among those who thinks he is a socialist.</s>SUNUNU: No. But I'm saying -- no, but what I'm telling you is he ought to be worried that he's making small businesspeople feel that way.</s>BLITZER: Well, let me ask you this question, because I -- I asked it earlier and I keep asking this question. If this president is so anti-business, as so many Republicans now allege...</s>SUNUNU: Right.</s>BLITZER: -- why has Wall Street done so great over the past three years, going from, what, 6,500 in the Dow Jones Industrial Average to almost 13,000 right now and these huge companies are sitting on bill -- hundreds of billions, if not trillions, of dollars in -- in assets?</s>SUNUNU: Let's take the last point you made. They are sitting on trillions of dollars in assets. You know what they're waiting for? They're waiting to see who wins this election. If Oba -- if President Obama is re-elected, that investment money leaves the country. If -- if Mitt Romney is reelected -- is elected, that investment co -- money is used to buy equipment here and to do hiring. You're exactly right. They're sitting on trillions of dollars because they're scared to death that this president might get re-elected.</s>BLITZER: But you agree that they've made a ton of money over the past three years, record profits for a lot of these big business corporations?</s>SUNUNU: But they have not invested it to create jobs because they're scared stiff of the man in the White House. Yes, they've done well. They've worked hard. You're not going to denigrate the business community for -- for dealing with the difficult environment of climate and of -- of the climate situation on the economic side. They've done a good job. They've worked to -- to bring themselves back. They've created more efficiencies in their factories. They have done what they should do, not with government's help, not with leadership from the White House, but because they're good businesspeople. And -- and now we shouldn't condemn them for having done that and say that somehow the president deserves credit, because these people brought themselves up by the boot straps.</s>BLITZER: Let -- let me play one clip for you from a new ad that the president has just put out.</s>SUNUNU: Yes.</s>BLITZER: I want to get your reaction to this. We're almost out of the time but...</s>SUNUNU: You've got to be careful.</s>BLITZER: I want -- I want...</s>SUNUNU: Be careful, Wolf...</s>BLITZER: Yes.</s>SUNUNU: -- because I will probably give you an extremely hot reaction.</s>BLITZER: All right. Well, I want you to listen to this. And you can give me any reaction you want. This is a free country, obviously, Governor.</s>SUNUNU: Uh-huh.</s>BLITZER: You and I have known each other for a long time.</s>SUNUNU: Right. Right.</s>BLITZER: All right, so listen to this latest Obama campaign ad, then I'll ask a question.</s>BEGIN VIDEO CLIP, COURTESY OBAMA FOR AMERICA) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It makes you wonder if some years he paid any taxes at all. We don't know, because Romney has released just one full year of his tax returns and won't release anything before 2010.</s>MITT ROMNEY (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: You know what, I've put out as much as we're going to put out.</s>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What is Mitt Romney hiding?</s>BLITZER: All right, now, as you know, Governor. There are a lot of Republicans out there who say, you know what, Governor, go ahead and release these tax returns. We're talking about George Will, Bill Kristol...</s>SUNUNU: Right.</s>BLITZER: -- Haley Barbour, the former chairman of the Republican Party, Brit Hume on Fox News last night. Rick Perry, the governor of Texas, he said this on January 16th in one of the Republican presidential debates. (</s>BEGIN VIDEO CLIP FROM JANUARY 16) GOV. RICK PERRY (R), TEXAS: Mitt, we need for you to release your income tax so the people of this country can see...</s>PERRY: -- how you made your money. And -- and I think that's a -- I think that's a fair thing.</s>BLITZER: All right, so go ahead. You can now say whatever you want.</s>SUNUNU: Sure.</s>BLITZER: Respond to some of your fellow...</s>SUNUNU: First of all...</s>BLITZER: -- fellow Republicans.</s>SUNUNU: Yes, and if -- if Governor Romney releases two years, they're going to play games saying he should have four. If he releases four, they're going to ask for 12. If he releases 12, he's going to ask for 20. And, frankly, with the way they're playing games with just about everything, Governor Romney is absolutely right that he ought not to give them a couple of thousand pages to play games with. But let me talk about that ad, because that ad, in my opinion, defines President Obama. And I think he says, at the end, \"I'm President Obama and I agree -- and I support this message,\" right?</s>BLITZER: Yes.</s>SUNUNU: Ok. So let's talk about that ad. That ad is trying to President O that Mitt Romney didn't pay taxes. Mitt Romney is such a public figure, everyone knows that if he didn't pay taxes, the IRS would be all over him. So there is no way the Obama administration -- campaign -- and President Obama can't know that the IRS did not President O that Mitt Romney didn't pay taxes, which means they know that what they're saying is not true, which -- which draws me to only one conclusion -- when they say that something that's not true and the president of the United States puts the words \"I support this message\" at the end of it, knowing that what they say is not true, then the campaign is lying. And so people should understand that when they hear that ad, all they're hearing is a campaign that knows that there is no way that Mitt Romney could have done what their insun -- insinuating, and, therefore, they're not telling the truth and the president is not telling the truth.</s>BLITZER: Governor, this conversation, no doubt, will continue. Sorry we couldn't get you in front of a camera. We will do that the next time. Appreciate your joining us.</s>SUNUNU: I'm sorry the connection didn't work. But thanks for the chance to come on, Wolf. We really appreciate it. And, frankly, I enjoyed it.</s>BLITZER: All right, Governor, thanks so much. Governor, former governor of New Hampshire, John Sununu, explaining what he said earlier in the day. This conversation, by the way, this -- this commotion over this is obviously not going to go away. We'll have much more coming up in our new 6:00 p.m. Eastern hour, as well. Meanwhile, other stories we're following. Needles, yes, needles found hidden inside airline sandwiches. We have new details into the investigation. And a major change is growing in the world's most isolated country. Standby.",

    "document": "Speaker 0: Excuse me. Excuse me. Thank you. Communications. Madam Secretary, do we have any communications?\nSpeaker 3: None, Mr. President.\nSpeaker 0: We do have one proclamation this evening, and I will be reading that as proclamation 0011 2017 celebrating the National Western such stock show Radio Rodeo and Horse Show to Denver. And if you look up here and you're wondering why we all looked so crazy as city councilmembers, that's why. Because it is a national stock show week and I'm read this proclamation. We're asked the annual National Western Stock Show Rodeo and Horse Show opens in Denver for the 111th time on January seven, 2017. And. Whereas, the National Western Stock Show is stored a story treasured of Denver's pass with a unique and colored history dating all the way back to 1906. Whereas Mayor Robert W Spear declare Wednesday, January 34th first 1906 as Denver Stock Show Day, an official holiday in the city of Denver so everyone could partake in the first ever stock show in Denver. It was on this day that the banks, the banks, department stores and other businesses on every corner of Denver shut their doors at noon while the streetcars hustle from 15th Street, Loup down every 3 minutes to the stockyards site and the Burlington Railroad raged and rush special trains from the Denver Union Depot for a round trip charge of $0.25. Those were the days. Whereas today the primary mission of the National Western Stock Show is to educate urban and suburban citizens about the importance of understanding and preserving Colorado citizens, about the importance of Western heritage in agriculture, providing city kids a hands on experience with farm animals, and to host one of the world's largest professional rodeo and horse shows. And. WHEREAS, The National Western Stock Show annually annually attracts more than 600,000 visitors in just a couple of weeks from over 50 states and 40 foreign countries, and contributes approximately 100 million to the Denver economy. And. WHEREAS, activities during the 16 day event include Wild West shows, show horses, dancing horses, extreme dogs, the Super Bowl of Livestock Shows and Art of the Expedition, and also Colorado's largest agriculture trade show. And. Whereas, The City and county of Denver has embarked on a historic partnership with the National Western Stock Show, Colorado State University, the Denver Museum of Nature and Science. The Colorado History. A History Colorado Museum setting in motion the development. The National Western Center with a mission to become a global destination and agricultural heritage and innovation now therefore being proclaimed by the City and Council, the Council of the City and County of Denver, Section one, that that the Council hereby enthusiastically, as you can see by our dress, welcomes the 100 and left 111th annual national Western Stock Show Rodeo and Horse Show to Denver extends its best wishes for another exciting and successful year and encouraging Denver residents. To saddle up and enjoy the show. Section two that the clerk of the city and county of Denver shall attest and affix a seal to the city and county of Denver to this proclamation and the copy be transmitted to the National Western Stock Show, Rodeo and Horse Show. And I move the proclamation 10011 series of 2017 be adopted. It has been moved. And second it I'll make a couple of comments because I'm sure we'll have a ton of comments by members of council. I'll take us back to 2011, and it was about the spring when there were conversations that we could lose the Fox show . And, you know, there's probably the class that I came in with, which was Councilman Ortega and Councilwoman Kennedy and Councilman Herndon also Sussman. One of the things we were all run for office we all heard about was don't let the stock show leave. This is one of the most storied projects and events in our city. And it was amazing because it was every neighborhood was saying how important this event was and how much it means to Denver. And, you know, as someone who was running for office, it allowed me to really understand what Denver is all about and how Denver cares about its hair, its heritage. The other thing that just shocked me was that kids and specifically my three kids, my urban kids, love the stock show more than they love Disneyland, more than they love images, more than they love everything else. They love the Styrofoam, and they can't wait for the stock show to happen because there's something special about kids in the urban environment connecting to our agriculture agricultural roots here in the state of Colorado. And so I'm excited to be supporting this. And now, with our eyes fixed on the future of what the National Western Center can be, this this stock show, this just two or three weeks long, is now going to be a year round venue mix with other institutions so that we start really talking about how to take agriculture throughout the world and what is it truly mean to feed the world. That is the vision of the stock show and we're really excited about it. And I want to say this because I think it's really important. I think any time you do a large project in a city, there's going to be all kind of controversy around it. The stock show last year during the bond initiative to see every precinct in the city of Denver supported, to see every precinct. More than that, the neighborhoods surrounding the stock show enthusiastically support what is happening at the National Western Center. And so it is it is my pleasure to bring this famed proclamation forward. My colleague, Councilwoman Monteiro, brought it four years before me and before her, Councilwoman Ortega as well. And so I'm excited to put this forward and now let my colleagues chime in. Councilman McKinney.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you, Mr. President. I don't have much to add to your your glowing proclamation. I will add that in addition to the cultural heritage it brings, we appreciate the job growth that's going to come from both the construction phase as well as the permanent jobs. Many of us have been engaged in conversations about how to make sure that that benefits the residents of the city and really helps build new career pathways. So it's both, you know, once a year show, but coming a year round attraction and a year round facility as well is a goal. I did want to share some bad news that we just got, which is that the parade for this year will not be occurring on Friday as it was scheduled. So for members of the public who may have been planning to go and watch the steers come down the 16th Street Mall appears that the cold weather and snow forecast in the interests of safety. They are not going to be having the parade this year. So just wanted to let the public know that if you might be watching. Thank you, Mr. President.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Councilwoman, can each councilman do.\nSpeaker 7: Thank you, Mr. President. I just want to wholeheartedly support the proclamation and just say that Kelly Lee, the executive director of the National Weather Center, gave a wonderful presentation that the Land Use Transportation Committee meeting this morning. And if anyone in the public missed that, they can see it again on Channel eight. It was so informative. He went over what was going to be involved with the West National Weather Center. The wonderful developments are going to be here. The partnerships are going to be. Developed with the whole center. And if you haven't had a chance to see it, I encourage you to check it out. Generally. Thank you very much.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilman Nu. All right, Councilman Clark.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you, Mr. President. I just wanted to say that, you know, I grew up in Denver and I'm a bit of a city slicker. And the first time that I ever saw most of the. Animals that I've ever seen other than the ones living in my yard was at the stock show. And I remember as a kid going there on field trips and going out there and having that experience that I would have never had otherwise. So I'd encourage all families living in the city, get your kids out there. I remember it was the first time literally I ever saw a chicken in my life.\nSpeaker 5: Was at the stock.\nSpeaker 4: Show. And I think as an environmental educator before this job, that connection, when you're when you're a city dweller, when you live in the city, that connection to the environment but also to where our food comes from is so important and so critical for all of us to really understand. And then I just want to point out that today, even because of the stock show, I had another first for a city slicker like me and that I rode my bike to work, which I do on a daily basis in cowboy boots.\nSpeaker 5: Just for this proclamation.\nSpeaker 4: So thank you, Mr. President, for bringing this forward. And thank you to the stock show for continuing to push me a little bit out of my comfort zone as a city slicker.\nSpeaker 0: That's incredible. It's cold outside. All right, Councilman Ortega.\nSpeaker 8: Thank you, Mr. President. I just wanted to chime in on the comments being made about this annual event, as you indicated in the proclamation, the. The financial contribution that it gives to the city coffers each year is is important, impressive and will only continue to grow once the facility is built out. I appreciate the fact that there continue to be ongoing conversations with the adjacent neighborhoods regarding the build out of the stock show complex. Some of the issues that we heard in testimony earlier prior to this comment about environmental issues are are also issues that will have to be addressed as part of the clean up of the soils of the national western complex. And that was part of the $800 million that was approved by the taxpayers. That includes the build out of this complex. The opportunities that this presents for young people in our community is really important. As a couple of my colleagues have stated, you know, if if it weren't for this event, most inner city kids would never have the opportunity to actually pet some of these animals. And they have a small petting zoo as part of the stock show where you can go up to the top floor and actually have pictures taken with your kids, petting some of the various animals that are in that section. It's an opportunity for farmers and ranchers to be able to purchase some of the equipment that they need for their facilities, for their their ranches and farms, and for people like me that like to go look at the apparel, boots, skirts, shirts, jackets, you know, those kinds of things. It's an opportunity. And that's where part of that sales tax revenue comes back to the city of Denver. So for families who have not had a chance to get out there, I would encourage them to take their children. We do have the opportunity where a number of kids get to go with their schools. The schools take tours not just from Denver, but from throughout the metro area. And so it's not unusual to see busses lined up with small kids, you know, going to enjoy this annual event. So to the folks at National Western, thanks for your ongoing work and all of the additional work that's yet to be done that looks at building this out. That brings CSU to be one of the partners in this. I know at some point in 2017, we'll be having a conversation on what that government structure is going to look like. So there's there's still additional conversations yet to be had about, you know, kind of what this is going to look like, not just physically, but how it will will function and interface with the city approval processes , etc., etc.. I know that as contracts were being let out, compliance with our cities and BWB goals is another important element that I understand is being complied with as well. So lots of fun and exciting things happening with this overall complex and the things that are yet to come in the future. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Councilwoman Ortega. Councilman Flynn.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you, Mr. President. As the council representative for Southwest Denver District two, very proud to be apparently be the only member wearing the white hat tonight as the home of the the former family ranch of longtime stock show CEO and now chairman Patrick Pat Grant. I would just like to say that that it's a wonderful occasion to have the stock show here in January. But I'm a little dumbfounded having always associated the stock show weather with below zero temperatures that we're not going to see the parade this year. Thank you, Mr. Chair.\nSpeaker 0: All right. Thank you, Councilman Flynn. When I when I was. Yeah, just as a tween in Wyoming, I just dreaded wearing snaps, shirts with snaps. But I do want to thank the stock show, because now in my elderly years, it's kind of fun. So you guys give me that opportunity to own this fancy hat. And the other one I bought this summer and these duds and and it's in, in really just wanted to take this opportunity to say it's a wonderful thing and I'm glad it's been here for a long time and it will be here for a long time . And I want everybody to know that it is a lot of fun and you will find something to do there. So, you know, if you find yourself with.\nSpeaker 5: Any time in these next. 22 days or.\nSpeaker 0: Whatever it is, get out there and just spend it there and you're going to have a good time. So thank you. Thank you. Councilman Espinosa. Councilman Lopez.\nSpeaker 5: Thank you. Council President Brooks, I thank you for bringing this proclamation forward again and again. I love being able to see the stock show in town. But also it's one of those things that's almost like a Grateful Dead concert where you can actually smell it before it comes.\nSpeaker 1: Right. Councilman Castro.\nSpeaker 5: He's never bought it. No, I used to take the tickets at McNichols and you can hear the you can almost smell the dead heads come in before they walked in the place. The same thing with the stock show the other day. We were outside and my daughter, what's that smell up. Up on as a stock show. And that's how, you know, in Denver, the stock shows in town. And, you know, the good thing is that this year, the second year, we actually get to celebrate the passage of two C and our reinvestment in the stock showing not necessarily keep. It was always going to be in Denver. You know the 100 year lease kept it here. But you know for us as making sure we had the the facilities that that rightfully the stock show deserve. This is the Super Bowl of rodeos. This is the Super Bowl of the stock shows and in the in the U.S. And it deserves that that infrastructure that that was starting to age. And the good thing is that we're keeping it's like an old Chevy. We're keeping the good parts, the nice chrome or polishing, but we're just restoring and taking it to another level. I just want to remind folks that, you know, as as much as we, you know, in the campaign and in this effort, as much as we really, really concentrated on those those facilities and upgrading that stock show and modernizing it, let's remind ourselves that we also are restoring a mile of the Platte River and making a park space out of a connecting to the grid into Elyria in Swansea and Globeville. And it's infrastructure for the community and yes, jobs. But it's also an opportunity if we're going to talk about agriculture, I think we should talk about making sure that that community has a grocery store. Finally, this is a neighborhood that has been dying for a grocery store. It's the one thing that we've always wanted to see happen. And this is the opportunity, if we really wanted to create that that that that tie to agriculture and teach folks, especially our children, that the food doesn't just magically appear at the store, that it's it's it's harvested. There's a science behind it. There's it's grown, it's picked, there's labor, there's hands, hands like mine. My grandfathers grew up in all in love that picked these beets, right? That put these on the store shelves. And so there's that whole history there. And that's our opportunity to teach it, but also our opportunity to actually fill in the blanks in some of these areas. And I think the stock show presents that opportunity, and I would love to be able to see that happen sometime soon. And, you know, the stock show, it is it's our culture, it's our history. And it's nothing of the past. And it's much more than just just a style of dress. It's it's it's who we are in Colorado. And you know what, Councilman Clark, like, you grew up here, but. In Westwood and in Barnum. We had chickens all the time, and they were delicious, man.\nSpeaker 1: The goats are delicious. So.\nSpeaker 5: Yeah, it doesn't you know, it's not a a rare occurrence to hear roosters in the morning in the West Side or, you know, smell the delicious goat that used to be chewing on your grass at a barbecue not too long. I'm talking about things that we don't permit. Anyway, having said that, I'm really I'm really proud to see the 111th in Denver again.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Councilman Lopez, I think County Councilman Cashman, you're up.\nSpeaker 4: Yes, sir. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you for bringing this proclamation forward. It is really exciting to be on Denver City Council in 2017 and and have a role at helping to shape this bright, shiny ever becoming more and new city that we're building for the 21st century and beyond. And where it's probably never been more important that we reach back to our roots that actually define us. There are other cities around the country and around the world that have these bright, shiny new buildings and new infrastructure. But there's not another city in the country that has a celebration of Western culture as the National Western Stock Show. So it's it's institutions like the National Western that truly do that have separated us as a city since our our founding, and we'll continue to as we move forward. So I'm just proud that my name to this proclamation. Thanks, Mr. President.\nSpeaker 0: Hey, thank you. Councilman Cashman, Calhoun, Ortega. You back up?\nSpeaker 8: Yeah. Just very briefly, I just wanted to ask that when you invite general manager Paul Andrews to come up, if maybe Paul, you wouldn't mind giving us an idea of the size of the purses for the winning cowboys that will be competing in the rodeo. Bull riding and bronc riding. Thanks. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Great. This concludes our comments. Madam Secretary, roll call.\nSpeaker 3: Black.\nSpeaker 8: Hi.\nSpeaker 3: Clark. Hi, Espinosa. Flynn. Hi, Gilmore. Herndon. Hi. Cashman. I can eat by Lopez. All right. New Ortega?\nSpeaker 8: Yeah.\nSpeaker 3: Sussman Hi. Mr. President.\nSpeaker 0: G r.\nSpeaker 3: 12 ice.\nSpeaker 1: T 39.\nSpeaker 3: 1313.\nSpeaker 0: I. Yeah, I got a I got a deal right here. I can see it is 13 eyes and proclamation, 11 passes. There is an individual I'd like to bring up. He got here just in the nick of time. We didn't think he was going to make it. He is the CEO of the National Western Stock Show and he has been an incredible partner. As we develop the National Western Center, please put your hands together for Mr. Paul Andrews. You guys, you're too kind. Thank you. As a hand. So excuse me for being tardy with the cancelation of the parade. You know, I'm going to go down in history as one of two presidents that have canceled the parade. But I'll explain that to you all here in a moment. But thank you. Before I do, thank you so much for all your great comments. It's humbling to hear all of you speak about the nation of Western, an institution that started in 1906, founded on education and agriculture and celebrating our Western heritage. You all take it very seriously. I can I can clearly see that. And we're very thankful to have all of you representing this fine city. And I also want to thank Mr. President here, who also is our representative in District nine. We're very lucky, Elvis, to have you. In all seriousness, and look forward to working with you closely in the future as well. The smell that you smell when the stock show is in town actually is the smell of money. And it's the smell of money because we are being visited by almost 600,000 people that are staying in our hotels, that are eating in our restaurants, that are showing their animals at our show. There will be almost all 50 states represented at the National Western Stock Show this year. Last year we had 42 states. We're growing by leaps and bounds. The enthusiasm for the Super Bowl of livestock shows is here and it's here to stay. And Denver is the place that it's going to continue forever. And that's what we're excited about. Rodeos we have, as you know, we start this weekend with our rodeos, three rodeos on opening day, Colorado versus the world champions of Colorado rodeos will face off against the world champions. It has become a spectacle to see. In fact, the Cowboys at the NFR in Las Vegas this year were texting us as the competition was going to confirm that they were going to be here for Colorado versus the world. That is a huge testament to this state, huge testament to this city and the enthusiasm the Cowboys have. So the question was asked by Council Woman Ortega, what is the rodeo purse? We will give out this year? Almost $700,000 in rodeo prize money. That will make us one of the top five rodeos in the world that will be performing this year. And you really can't count the NFR in Vegas and they are occupying the top few spots. But if you took them out, we'd be in the top three spots. And that is something to be said. And I can assure you as we enter the phases of the National Western Center, we will be able to increase that pot , making it even more lucrative for the Cowboys to come enjoy their 16 days in January right here with us. So enthusiasm is high and the parade usually is our kickoff. And boy, it became very, very crystal clear to me this morning from about 8 to 1030 in the morning with various representatives of Denver law enforcement, as well as meteorologists from all over this city. In consultation with me about the snow event that will occur Wednesday evening into Thursday, coupled with frigid low temperatures, it is just too risky to put animals out in that. Thus, it will cause potential injury both for the animal as well as any spectator. If you can imagine a horse that has shoes on, walking on ice, potentially, if that horse goes down, we would have a cataclysmic event and me as president and CEO will not allow that to happen. So unfortunately, we're going to usher in stock show this Saturday with the start of Colorado versus the world 800. Both spaces will be open and our trade show that was mentioned, we will have horse shows. We will have a ranch rodeo that day. And we will celebrate on Sunday, the Mexican rodeo extravaganza for two nights on Hispanic Heritage Day. And we will celebrate Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, three nights a PBR bull riding for those of you that just want to watch the Bulls. So again, thank you all for your tremendous support and thank all those voters that might be watching this that have continued to support the National Western Stock Show. Every district in this city voted yes for to see. And that really is a testament to the leadership of all of you and the testament to the deep roots that the Nation of Western Stock Show has here in Denver, Colorado. Thank you. Yeah, thank you, Paul. And thanks for your leadership. Really appreciate it. I just thought that the National Western Stock Show will be alone because there's no Bronco playoffs. So I think you're going to get a lot more attention and probably some more dollars as well.",

    "document": "The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is the third largest agency in the federal government in terms of personnel. The appropriations bill that funds it\u00e2\u0080\u0094providing $70 billion in FY2020\u00e2\u0080\u0094is the seventh largest of the 12 annual funding measures developed by the appropriations committees, and is the only appropriations bill that funds a single agency in its entirety and nothing else. This report provides an overview of the FY2021 budget request for the Department of Homeland Security. It provides a component-level overview of the appropriations sought in the FY2021 budget request, putting the requested appropriations in the context of the FY2020 requested and enacted level of appropriations, and noting some of the larger changes in this proposal from those baselines. To ensure consistency of methodology, the analysis in this report is based on Office of Management and Budget (OMB) data as presented in the FY2020 and FY2021 Budget in Brief for DHS, with supporting information from the DHS congressional budget justifications for FY2021, except where noted. Most other CRS reports rely on Congressional Budget Office (CBO) data, which was not available at the time of publication at a similar level of granularity. Numbers expressed in billions are rounded to the nearest hundredth ($10 million), while numbers expressed in millions are rounded to the nearest million. None of the FY2020 requested or enacted levels in this bill include supplemental appropriations requested and provided in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, as the intent is to analyze the FY2021 annual appropriations request in comparison to the preceding request and ensuing annual appropriation. The FY2021 budget request represents the fourth detailed budget proposed by the administration of President Donald J. Trump. It is the earliest release of a budget request by the Trump Administration, and comes 52 days after the enactment of the FY2020 consolidated appropriations measures\u00e2\u0080\u0094the longest such gap since the release of the FY2017 request (53 days), and the first since then to include prior-year enacted funding levels as a comparative baseline. This allows for easier analysis of the request compared to current funding. The budget for DHS includes a variety of discretionary and mandatory budget authority. Aside from standard discretionary spending, some of the discretionary spending in the bill is offset by collections of fees, reducing the net effect on the general fund of the Treasury. Some discretionary budget authority is specially designated under the Budget Control Act (BCA), adjusting the statutory limits on discretionary spending to accommodate it. DHS also draws resources from fee revenues and other collections included in the mandatory budget, which are not usually referenced in annual appropriations legislation. However, some mandatory spending items still require an appropriation because there is no dedicated source of funding to meet the government's obligations established in law\u00e2\u0080\u0094e.g., U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) retirement accounts. Figure 1 shows a breakdown of these different categories from the FY2021 budget request. Congress and the Administration may differ on how funding for the department is structured; frequently, administrations of both parties have suggested paying for certain activities with fee increases that would require legislative approval. If fees are not increased, additional discretionary appropriations must be provided to fund the planned activities. Figure 2 compares the structure of the FY2021 budget request to its enacted FY2020 equivalent, as well as the FY2020 request. Significant differences include In budget authority from discretionary appropriations, a $3 billion reduction in border barrier funding through U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) compared to the FY2020 request; and a $2.4 billion reduction from the enacted level of funding due to the proposed move of the U.S. Secret Service to the Department of the Treasury. In fee-funded discretionary budget authority, a $709 million increase in requested Transportation Security Administration (TSA) fee revenues; and In discretionary budget authority covered by adjustments under the BCA, a $9 billion reduction in disaster relief funding through the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) compared to the FY2020 request. Table 1 presents for comparison the requested gross budget authority controlled in appropriations legislation for FY2021 for each DHS component, as well as the level requested and enacted for FY2020. This is essentially composed of the first four elements in Figure 1 and Figure 2 . Four analytical columns on the right side of the table provide comparisons of the FY2021 requested funding levels with the FY2020 requested and enacted levels, indicating dollar and percentage change. Components are listed in order of their total FY2020 enacted gross budget authority. Indented and italicized lines beneath the Coast Guard and Federal Emergency Management Agency entries show the portion of the above amount covered by adjustments for disaster relief and overseas contingency operations, provided for under the BCA. The funding levels in Table 1 include the effects of all elements of the budget tracked in the detail tables accompanying annual appropriations for DHS, except rescissions of prior-year appropriations. While this table compares data developed with the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) scoring methodology and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) scoring methodology, most of the data compared is identical. Most of the $40 million in scoring differences identified by OMB is the result of $34 million differences in the treatment of fees, transfers and rounding within the CBP budget, with the remainder being the result of differences in rounding across the DHS funding structure. Table 1 illuminates several shifts within the FY2021 DHS budget request that are not apparent in top-line analysis: a $986 million increase from the FY2020 requested level for the U.S. Coast Guard; a $1.1 billion increase from the FY2020 requested level for Immigration and Customs Enforcement\u00e2\u0080\u0094$2 billion (24%) more than enacted in FY2020; a $456 million increase for the Transportation Security Administration's budget from the FY2020 requested level; and a proposed transfer of the Federal Protective Service from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency to the Management Directorate during the FY2020 process, shifting almost $1.6 billion between the components. Table 1 also illuminates budgetary pressure on DHS's smaller headquarters and support components. With one exception\u00e2\u0080\u0094Analysis and Operations\u00e2\u0080\u0094the seven smallest components by gross budget authority saw their budget requests reduced by at least 5% from the enacted level, and four of those components saw reductions of more than 10%. Under the Common Appropriations Structure (CAS) first implemented with the FY2017 DHS annual appropriation, most DHS discretionary appropriations were rearranged into four uniform categories: Operations and Support\u00e2\u0080\u0094generally personnel and operational costs (all components have this); Procurement, Construction, and Improvements\u00e2\u0080\u0094generally acquisition and construction (many components have this); Research and Development (TSA, USCG, USSS, CISA, S&T, and CWMD have this in the FY2021 budget request); and Federal Assistance (only FEMA and CWMD have this in the FY2021 budget request). FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund is a unique discretionary appropriation which was preserved separately, in part due to the history of the high level of public and congressional interest in that particular structure. The use of the CAS structure allows a quick survey of the level of departmental investment in these broad categories of spending through the appropriations process. A visual representation of this new structure follows in Figure 3 . On the left are the five appropriations categories of the CAS with a black bar representing the requested FY2021 funding levels requested for DHS for each. A sixth catch-all category is included for budget authority associated with the legislation that does not fit the CAS categories. Colored lines flow to the DHS components listed on the right, showing the amount of funding provided through each category to each component. The Operations and Support appropriation for each component pays for most DHS staffing. Table 2 analyzes changes to DHS staffing, as illuminated by the request's information on positions and full-time equivalents (FTEs) for each component. Appropriations legislation does not explicitly set these levels, so the information is drawn from budget request documents alone. The first data column indicates the number of positions requested for each component in the FY2021 budget request. The next four columns show the difference between the FY2021 request and the Administration's previous request\u00e2\u0080\u0094expressed numerically, then as a percentage\u00e2\u0080\u0094and then shows the same comparison with the FY2020 enacted number of positions as interpreted by the Administration. Another data column shows the number of FTEs, followed by four more analytical columns showing the same comparisons as were run for positions. The following summaries of the budget requests for DHS components are drawn from a survey of the DHS FY2021 B udget in Brief and the budget justifications for each component. Each begins with a graphic outlining the appropriations requested and enacted for the components in FY2020 and FY2021, followed by some observations on the factors that contribute to the illustrated structure. The appropriations request includes all funding provided through the appropriations measure, regardless of how it is scored: it does not include most mandatory spending, such as programs paid for directly by collected fees that have appropriations in permanent law. Each component has an Operations and Support appropriation, which includes discretionary funding for pay. A 3.1% civilian pay increase was adopted for 2020, and a 1.0% civilian pay increase has been proposed by the Administration for 2021. Descriptions of each Operations and Support appropriation note the impact of these pay increases and associated increases to component retirement contributions to better illuminate the changes in the level of other operational funding. The Administration's $15.60 billion appropriations request for CBP was $724 million (4.9%) above the FY2020 enacted level, and $2.55 billion (14.1%) below the level of appropriations originally requested for FY2020. The request includes $252 million more than enacted for Operations and Support, largely driven by $414 million for pay and retirement cost increases. $161 million was requested for 750 additional border patrol agents and 126 support staff. No additional appropriations were requested for new CBP Officers, who staff ports of entry. $21 million was requested for 300 Border Patrol Processing Coordinators, who are intended to take over non-law enforcement duties currently performed by Border Patrol Agents. The request for Operations and Support includes a new $7 million item for the Southwest Border Wall System Program, intended to maintain newly constructed barriers. $377 million more than enacted for Procurement, Construction, and Improvements. The $2.06 billion request for Border Security Assets and Infrastructure is $552 million more than enacted in annual appropriations for FY2020, and $3.12 billion less than requested in FY2020. The primary driver of this change from the FY2020 request is a reduction of $3.04 billion in construction funding for the border wall system. While the FY2020 Budget-in-Brief cites $182 million for facilities improvements and various investments for technology, aircraft, and vehicles, appropriations not for border barriers were reduced from the FY2020 enacted level of $529 million to $281 million in the request. The Administration's $9.93 billion appropriations request for ICE was $1.85 billion (22.9%) above the FY2020 enacted level, and $1.15 billion (13.0%) above the level of appropriations originally requested for FY2020. The request includes $1.79 billion more than enacted for Operations and Support, largely driven by a 4,636 position (22%) increase requested in personnel funded through appropriations. This increase would include 2,844 law enforcement officers and 1,792 support staff. While all of the primary programs under ICE would receive additional staff, Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) would receive 2,792 positions, a 34% increase above the current enacted level (8,201). Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) would receive 1,053 additional personnel, a 12% increase above the current enacted level (8,784). $220 million (12.3%) of the requested increase in Operations and Support appropriations is for pay and retirement increases. $58 million more than enacted for Procurement, Construction, and Improvements. This is $26 million more than the request for FY2020, growth largely driven by a nearly $14 million increase above the FY2020 requested level for Operational Communications and Information Technology. Also included in the Administration's request was $112 million in fee funding from the Immigration Examinations Fee Account\u00e2\u0080\u0094similar to a proposal not approved by Congress for FY2020\u00e2\u0080\u0094which would fund 936 current personnel. The Administration's $4.09 billion net appropriations request for TSA was $890 million (17.9%) below the FY2020 enacted level, and $175 million (4.5%) above the level of appropriations originally requested for FY2020. With the resources from offsetting fees included, the gross discretionary total is for a request of $7.63 billion, $181 million (2.3%) below the FY2020 enacted level, and $334 million (4.6%) above the FY2020 requested level. The request includes $820 million (16.9%) less than enacted in FY2020 for Operations and Support appropriations, compensated for in large part by $709 million in proposed increases to offsetting collections. Operations and Support cost increases within this amount include $251 million for paying increased pay and retirement costs. $77 million (69.7%) less in discretionary appropriations than enacted in FY2020 for Procurement, Construction, and Improvements; $129 million less in discretionary appropriations than was requested for FY2020. $250 million continues to be provided in mandatory appropriations from the Aviation Security Capital Fund as it has since FY2004. $7 million (28.9%) more than enacted in FY2020 for Research and Development appropriations, on the basis of $8 million for two new projects to improve threat detection at TSA checkpoints. The Administration's $12.11 billion appropriations request for USCG was $139 million (1.2%) above the FY2020 enacted level, and $986 million (8.9%) above the level of appropriations originally requested for FY2020. The request included $196 million (2.4%) more than enacted in FY2020 for Operations and Support, $164 million of which is for pay and retirement increases, and increases to allowances for military personnel. For the first time in many years, the costs of Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) were proposed for inclusion in the base discretionary appropriation for Operations and Support, without designation to adjust the discretionary budget limits to accommodate it. The OCO proposal was for $215 million in FY2021, up $25 million from the FY2020 enacted level. The budget request also included more than $30 million in increases for cyber operations. $135 million (7.6%) less than enacted for Procurement, Construction, and Improvements. Reductions of $130 million (80.7%) for the National Security Cutter program and $240 million (92.3%) for the Fast Response Cutter program were offset by increases of $234 million (75%) for the Offshore Patrol Cutter program and $420 million (311%) for the Polar Security Cutter program, as part of a net increase of $286 million (28.8%) for USCG vessels procurement. $351 million (69.6%) less than enacted was requested for USCG aircraft procurement. $13 million (18.6%) less than enacted was requested for other acquisition programs, and $58 million (28.3%) less than enacted for Shore Facilities and Aids to Navigation. Less than $1 million (6.6%) more than enacted was requested for Research and Development. The Administration's budget request envisions moving the USSS to the Department of the Treasury. However, the budget is still structured as it would be in DHS, and the numbers are provided here for analytical purposes. The $2.36 billion appropriations request for USSS was $55 million (2.3%) below the FY2020 enacted level, and $52 million (2.2%) above the level of appropriations originally requested for FY2020. The request included $26 million (1.1%) less than enacted for Operations and Support, despite $71 million being added for the costs of pay and retirement increases. The primary driver of the decrease was the anticipated reduction of $86 million in costs from the conclusion of the 2020 presidential election cycle. $20 million for 119 additional personnel and $20 million in transition costs for the proposed transition of the USSS back to Treasury also are included in the request. $29 million (42.8%) less than enacted in FY2020 for Procurement, Construction, and Improvements, and less than $1 million (4.2%) less than enacted for Research and Development. The Administration's $1.76 billion appropriations request for CISA was $258 million (12.8%) below the FY2020 enacted level, and $150 million (9.3%) above the level of net appropriations originally requested for FY2020. The request included $128 million (8.2%) less than enacted in FY2020 for Operations and Support, despite $28 million being added for the costs of pay and retirement increases. The reduction is largely driven by the proposal to convert the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism and Safety program to a voluntary initiative, reducing program costs by $68 million, and a $34 million reduction in Threat Analysis and Response. $121 million (27.9%) less than enacted in FY2020 for Procurement, Construction, and Improvements, largely driven by a $114 million reduction in Cybersecurity Assets and Infrastructure, $75 million of which is to the National Cybersecurity Protection System. $8 million (55.4%) less than enacted in FY2020 for Research and Development, due to reductions in funding for the Technology Development and Deployment Program and National Infrastructure Simulation and Analysis Center. The Administration's $9.36 billion appropriations request for FEMA was $12.92 billion (58.0%) below the FY2020 enacted level, and $8.65 billion (48.0%) below the level of appropriations originally requested for FY2020. The primary driver of this change is a $12.29 billion reduction from the enacted level for the costs of major disasters (a large portion of the resources in the Disaster Relief Fund). If this reduction is set aside, the request is a $628 million reduction from the FY2020 enacted level, and a $364 million increase from the FY2020 request. The request includes $32 million (2.9%) more than enacted for Operations and Support, $32 million of which is for pay and retirement increases (the combination of other increases and decreases in the account has a net zero effect); $47 million (35.1%) less than enacted for Procurement, Construction, and Improvements, largely due to lower requests for grants management modernization, Mount Weather facilities, and the Center for Domestic Preparedness; $696 million (21.9%) less than enacted for Federal Assistance, largely due to reduction in preparedness grants, the Flood Hazard Mapping and Risk Analysis Program, and elimination of the Emergency Food and Shelter Program; and $12.21 billion (68.4%) less than enacted for the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF). The request for the portion of the DRF that covers major disasters dropped from an enacted level of $17.35 billion to $5.06 billion, a request that is based on the average of the last 10 years obligations for major disasters costing less than $500 million (termed \"non-catastrophic disasters\"), and spending plans for past disasters costing FEMA more than $500 million (termed \"catastrophic disasters\"). The portion of the DRF that covers emergencies and other activities increased $82 million (16.1%) to $521 million, largely on the basis of an increase in the 10-year average of those costs, and $15 million for real estate needs associated with FEMA's Recovery Service Centers. The Administration's $119 million appropriations request for USCIS was $14 million (10.4%) below the FY2020 enacted level, and $3 million (2.4%) below the level of appropriations originally requested for FY2020. The request includes $4 million (3.0%) less for Operations and Support than enacted in FY2020, and $3 million (2.4%) less than requested\u00e2\u0080\u0094$2 million in increased pay raise and retirement costs were offset by reduced costs for rent and efficiencies through modernization efforts. The request does not include an appropriations request for Federal Assistance, which received $10 million in the FY2020 enacted DHS appropriations bill for Citizenship and Integration Grants, which the Administration proposes funding through Immigration Examinations Fee revenues. Less than 3% of the USCIS budget is appropriated. The budget request projects more than $4.9 billion in mandatory spending for USCIS\u00e2\u0080\u009497% of its total budget\u00e2\u0080\u0094will be supported by fees in FY2021, up $213 million (4.5%) from FY2020 levels. This overall structure is similar to last year's request. The Administration's $331 million appropriations request for FLETC was $20 million (5.6%) below the FY2020 enacted level, and $19 million (5.5%) below the level of appropriations originally requested for FY2020. FLETC also anticipates receiving $211 million (up $25 million, or 13.4%) in reimbursements for training and facilities use from those it serves. The request includes $12 million (4.3%) more than was enacted in FY2020 for Operations and Support, $7 million of which is for increased pay and retirement costs; $32 million (55.3%) less than was enacted in FY2020 for Procurement, Construction, and Improvements, due to completion of funding for projects in the FY2020 enacted appropriation. The FY2021 budget includes $26 million for the purchase of two dorms it currently leases. The Administration's $644 million appropriations request for the S&T Directorate was $94 million (12.7%) below the FY2020 enacted level, and $62 million (10.6%) above the level of appropriations originally requested for FY2020. The request includes $30 million (9.6%) less than the enacted level for the Operations and Support appropriation, largely due to a $35 million (24.6%) reduction in mission support activities; Only $3 million of the Operations and Support request is for pay and retirement cost increases. $19 million in the Procurement, Construction, and Improvements appropriation (which had no funding requested or provided in FY2020) for costs associated with the closure and sale of the Plum Island Animal Disease Center; and $82 million (19.5%) less than enacted for the Research and Development appropriation, due to a $64 million (16.6%) reduction in in-house research activities and a $19 million (46.3%) reduction in university-based research. The Administration's $377 million appropriations request for CWMD was $55 million (12.8%) below the FY2020 enacted level, and $46 million (10.9%) below the level of appropriations originally requested for FY2020. The request includes $7 million (3.7%) less than the enacted level for the Operations and Support appropriation, $40 million (18.7%) less than was requested for FY2020; This reduction is driven by a $5 million (40.7%) reduction in funding for the National Biosurveillance Integration Center's biosurveillance and early warning support on biological attacks and emerging pandemics, and an almost $3 million reduction in technical forensics operational readiness, which the request says is being funded by the National Nuclear Security Administration. $1 million (0.4%) was requested for covering the increased pay and retirement costs. $32 million (26.5%) less than the enacted level for the Procurement, Construction, and Improvements appropriation, largely driven by reductions to the Radiation Portal Monitor Replacement Program ($46 million, 68.1%) and Common Viewer program ($8 million, zeroed out); $11 million (15.9%) less than the enacted level for the Research and Development appropriation, largely driven by a $7 million reduction in Technical Forensics and a $9 million (27.3%) reduction in detection capability activity; and $6 million (9.3%) less than the enacted level for the Federal Assistance appropriation, largely due to an $11 million (44.6%) reduction in funding for the Securing the Cities program. The Administration's $150 million appropriations request for OSEM was $28 million (15.9%) below the FY2020 enacted level, and $9 million (6.4%) above the level of appropriations originally requested for FY2020. The request includes $18 million (10.9%) less than enacted level for the Operations and Support appropriation, largely driven by a $15 million (25.9%) reduction in operations and engagement activities. The request included $5 million to pay for increased salary and retirement costs. $10 million less than the enacted level for the Federal Assistance program, as the targeted violence grants funded in this component in FY2020 are funded in the FEMA request for FY2021. The Administration's $1.76 billion appropriations request for MD was $198 million (12.7%) above the FY2020 enacted level, and $204 million (13.1%) above the level of appropriations originally requested for FY2020. The request includes $220 million (18.6%) more than was enacted in FY2020 for the Operations and Support appropriation, $186 million of which is net transfers as a result of DHS transitioning away from using a working capital fund; Also included in this appropriations request is a $13 million increase to cover increased pay and retirement costs. Of the remaining changes, most of the net increase is due to investments in information technology and cybersecurity. $22 million (5.7%) less than was enacted in FY2020 for the Procurement, Construction, and Improvement appropriation. Of the $359 million requested, over $200 million was for investments in DHS headquarters facilities, including St. Elizabeths; Mount Weather; and consolidation of headquarters leases. The Administration's $313 million appropriations request for A&O was $28 million (10.0%) above the FY2020 enacted level, and $36 million (13.0%) above the level of appropriations originally requested for FY2020. Most of the details of the A&O budget request are classified. However, the request included a $6 million increase to cover increases in pay and retirement costs. The Administration's $178 million appropriations request for the OIG was $12 million (6.5%) below the FY2020 enacted level, and $8 million (4.5%) above the level of appropriations originally requested for FY2020. $5 million in additional funding is requested to cover increased pay and retirement costs. The budget request includes a reduction of more than $15 million (16.5%) in OIG audits and investigations. The budget justification notes that the OIG submitted a funding request of $196 million, which the OIG states \"is essential to sustain FY 2020 operations into FY 2021 at the FY 2020 appropriated level and maintain oversight capacity commensurate with the Department's growth in several high-risk areas, including frontline security and infrastructure along the southern border, cybersecurity defenses, major acquisitions and investments, and accelerated hiring of law enforcement personnel.\" Administrative provisions are included at the end of each title of the DHS appropriations bill and generally provide direction to a single component within that title. In the FY2021 budget request, the Administration proposed a number of changes from the FY2020 enacted DHS appropriations measure, including Deleting \u00c2\u00a7106, which established the Ombudsman for Immigration Detention. Adding a new section related to the proposed transfer of the Secret Service to the Department of the Treasury, which would allow for funds from the DHS OIG to be transferred to the Treasury OIG. Deleting \u00c2\u00a7207-\u00c2\u00a7212, which barred any new land border crossing fees; required an expenditure plan be submitted to Congress for the CBP Procurement, Construction, and Improvements appropriation before any of that appropriation could be obligated; constrained the use of the CBP Procurement, Construction, and Improvements appropriation, including limiting the types and locations of border barriers that could be constructed and requiring reporting to the appropriations committees on (1) the plans for barrier construction, (2) changes in barrier construction priorities, and (3) consultation with affected local communities, as well as an annual update to risk-based plan for improving border security; barred construction of barriers in certain locations; required statutory authorization for reducing vetting operations at the CBP's National Targeting Center; and directed certain CBP Operations and Support appropriations to humanitarian needs at the border and addressing health, life, and safety issues at Border Patrol facilities. Deleting \u00c2\u00a7216, which barred DHS from detaining or removing a sponsor, potential sponsor or the family member of sponsor or potential sponsor of an unaccompanied alien child on the basis of information from the Department of Health and Human Services, unless a background check reveals certain felony convictions or association with prostitution or child labor violators; Deleting \u00c2\u00a7227, which provided flexibility in allocating Coast Guard Overseas Contingency Operations funding; Deleting \u00c2\u00a7229, which bars the use of funds to conduct or implement an A-76 competition for privatizing activities at the National Vessel Documentation Center; Deleting \u00c2\u00a7231-\u00c2\u00a7232, which were changes to permanent law (and thus no longer required inclusion in the bill) that allowed for continued death gratuity payments for the USCG if appropriated funding was unavailable for obligation; and categorized amounts credited to the Coast Guard Housing Fund as offsetting receipts. Deleting \u00c2\u00a7233-\u00c2\u00a7236, which allowed the Secret Service to obligate funds in advance of reimbursement by other federal agencies for training expenses; barred the Secret Service from protecting agency heads other than the secretary of DHS, unless an agreement is reached with DHS to do so on a reimbursable basis; allowed the Secret Service to reprogram up to $15 million in its Operation and Support appropriation; and allowed flexibility for Secret Service employees on protective missions to pay for travel without regard to limitations on costs, with prior notification to the appropriations committees. Adding \u00c2\u00a7308, which requires a 25% nonfederal contribution for projects funded under the State Homeland Security Grant Program, Urban Area Security Initiative, Public Transportation Security Assistance, Railroad Security Assistance, and Over-the-Road Bus Security Assistance programs\u00e2\u0080\u0094currently there is no such cost share; and Adding \u00c2\u00a7309, which would allow a transfer 1% of funding provided for the State Homeland Security Grant Program and Urban Area Security Initiative to FEMA Operations and Support for evaluations of the effectiveness of those programs. General provisions are included in the last title of the DHS appropriations bill and generally provide direction to the entire department. They include rescissions or additional budget authority in some cases. In the FY2021 budget request, the Administration proposed relatively few substantive changes to the general provisions enacted in the FY2020 bill. They sought to: Remove \u00c2\u00a7530, which provided $41 million for reimbursement of extraordinary law enforcement costs for protecting the residence of the President; Remove \u00c2\u00a7532, which required that DHS allow Members of Congress and their designated staff access to DHS facilities housing aliens for oversight purposes; and Remove \u00c2\u00a7537-\u00c2\u00a7540, which rescinded prior year appropriations from various accounts.",

    "human_reference": "On February 10, 2020, the Donald J. Trump Administration released their budget request for FY2021, including a $75.84 billion budget request for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). DHS is the third largest agency in the federal government in terms of personnel. The appropriations bill that funds it\u00e2\u0080\u0094providing $70 billion in FY2020\u00e2\u0080\u0094is the seventh largest of the twelve annual funding measures developed by the appropriations committees, and is the only appropriations bill that funds a single agency in its entirety and nothing else. This report provides an overview of the FY2021 budget request for the Department of Homeland Security. It provides a component-level overview of the appropriations sought in the FY2021 budget request, putting the requested appropriations in the context of the FY2020 requested and enacted level of appropriations, and noting the primary drivers of changes from the FY2020 enacted level. The FY2021 budget request represents the fourth detailed budget proposed by the Trump Administration. It is the earliest release of a budget request by the Trump Administration, and comes 52 days after the enactment of the FY2020 consolidated appropriations measures\u00e2\u0080\u0094the longest such gap since the release of the FY2017 request (53 days), and the first since then to include prior-year enacted funding levels as a comparative baseline. Some of the major drivers of change in the FY2021 request include A $3 billion reduction in border barrier funding through U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) compared to the FY2020 request; A $2.4 billion reduction from the enacted level of funding due to the proposed move of the U.S. Secret Service to the Department of the Treasury; A $709 million increase in requested Transportation Security Administration (TSA) fee revenues; A $9 billion reduction in disaster relief funding through the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) compared to the FY2020 request; A $986 million increase from the FY2020 requested level for the U.S. Coast Guard\u00e2\u0080\u0094proposing funding $129 million above the enacted level; A $1.1 billion increase from the FY2020 requested level for Immigration and Customs Enforcement\u00e2\u0080\u0094$2 billion (24%) more than enacted in FY2020; and A $456 million increase for the Transportation Security Administration's budget from the FY2020 requested level\u00e2\u0080\u0094proposing funding $59 million below the enacted level. Six of the seven smallest components by gross budget authority saw their budget requests reduced by at least 5% from the enacted level, and four of those components saw reductions of more than 10%.

    "document": "Whatever you call them, it's always something of a surprise when a game between the biggest and best teams in any country actually turns out to be a footballing classic. Real Madrid and Barcelona attract viewers, but the cynicism on the pitch can drown out the quality in El Clasico. Borussia Dortmund are not consistently good enough to make Der Klassiker a regular spectacle. English football's closest equivalent, Liverpool taking on Manchester United, is now merely a battle for the top four. But, on Easter Sunday, Marseille and Paris St Germain played out a game that not only had a huge bearing on the Ligue 1 title race, but also easily lived up to it's billing as Le Classique. Paris St Germain players celebrate their win in the dressing room after the game, after twice coming from behind to beat rivals Marseille . Andre-Pierre Gignac gets up above Marquinhos to power home the opening goal for Marseille after half an hour . Blaise Matuidi is congratulated by his team-mates after bringing PSG level with a superb curling effort from the edge of the box . Gignac fires home his second goal past Salvatore Sirigu after a mistake from Marco Veratti gave him a clear run on goal, to make it 2-1 . Marquinhos jumps for joy after slamming the ball into the roof of the net to make it 2-2 after Zlatan Ibrahimovic's mis-hit free kick . Ibrahimovic put pressure on Jeremy Morel to force an own goal just two minutes later, as PSG went ahead for the first time in the game . Marseille: Mandanda, Romao, Fanni, Morel, Lemina, Dja Dj\u00e9dj\u00e9, Mendy, Payet, Thauvin (Ocampos 63 mins), Gignac (Batshuayi 71), Ayew (Alessandrini 72) Subs not used: Aloe, N'Koulou, Samba, Tuiloma .

Subs not used: Douchez, Cabaye, Bahebeck, Digne . Goals: Matuidi 35 Marquinhos 49, Morel OG 51 . Booked: Veratti, Pastore . In the end it was PSG who ran out winners, but they twice had to come from behind to see off their fierce rivals in a game that had passion, quality, and goals aplenty. The game was decided by a 130-second burst soon after the half-time break, in which the visitors came from 2-1 down to go 3-2 ahead, with Zlatan Ibrahimovic, predictably, involved in both goals, though not perhaps, in the way that would be expected. First the Swedish star slipped as he struck a free kick at goal, only to see his nothing effort land at the feet of\u00a0Brazilian defender Marquinhos, who slammed the ball into the roof of the net from close range. Just two minutes later Ibrahimovic might have been on hand to tap home Javier Pastore's low cross, but in the end his presence was enough to force defender Jeremy Morel to divert it past his own goalkeeper. It felt harsh on Marseille, who were the better side for large periods, but they were let down by defensive frailties and an inability to really punhish the PSG backline. Despite the hosts dominance of possession, the champions could easily have won this by three or four goals, such were their chances. Ibrahimovic had several excellent opportunities, the last of which saw Steve Mandanda pull off a remarkable save, while Pastore should have scored at least once, and Mandanda also did well to deny Matuidi late on. All of that without considering the chances the visitors missed before falling behind in the first half, with Ibrahimovic denied a penalty following a clumsy tackle by Morel, Pastore firing wide when clean through, and the woefully out of form Edinson Cavani scuffing a volley straight at the keeper after being picked out by a beautiful chipped pass.

Dimitri Payet gets a shot away under pressure from Marco Veratti of PSG in the Stade Veledrome as Marseille looked to take home advantage . On the other hand it is difficult to remember Salvatore Sirigu making too many meaningful saves in the second half, although he did acrobatically tip a Gignac header over the bar shortly before the break to deny the striker a hat-trick. With Lyon having briefly gone top of the table by beating Guingamp earlier in the weekend, it was a game both sides really needed to win to keep up their title challenges.\u00a0The result puts Laurent Blanc's men top of Ligue 1 again, and is a serious dent to Marseille's hopes. It all looked so different at half time, when an Andre-Pierre Gignac double had his side 2-1 up. The local-born hero first rose above Marquinhos at the back post to head past Sirigu on the half-hour, before slotting past the Italian shortly before half time to restore the lead. Both goals had an element of fortune, with Gignac climbing all over his defender to convert Dimitri Payet's cross, and Marco Veratti gifting him possession through on goal for the second, but nonetheless he took both well. In between was the pick of the goals, a stunner from Blaise Matuidi, who cut inside beautifully, before curling in from the edge of the box, via the fingertips of Mandanda and the inside of the post. PSG's win was marred only by an injury to David Luiz, withdrawn in the first half with what looked like a hamstring pull. But a win over their fierce rivals, and the return to the table's summit, will soften that blow. David Luiz is brought down, and the Brazilian defender was forced off soon after with a hamstring injury which looked serious . Marseille took the lead twice in the first half, but on both occasions they were unable to stay ahead for too long .

    "document": "USPS\u2019s mission is to provide universal postal service while operating as a self-financing entity, but USPS\u2019s current financial position is not sustainable. To achieve its mission, USPS must cover its expenses through revenues generated from the sale of its products and services. However, USPS\u2019s total operating expenses have exceeded total operating revenue each year since fiscal year 2007, including a $2.6 billion loss from operations in fiscal year 2017 alone (see fig. 1). Moreover, we have reported that USPS\u2019s overall financial condition is deteriorating. For example, in August 2018 we reported that USPS had about $149 billion in unfunded liabilities and debt at the end of fiscal year 2017. As a result, USPS\u2019s financial condition remains on our list of high- risk areas needing attention by Congress and the executive branch. According to USPS financial documents, its ability to sell innovative products and services will be a key factor in improving its financial condition. Thus, USPS established a strategic goal to \u201cinnovate faster to deliver value\u201d to its customers, by making investments in innovations that respond to rapidly evolving customer needs. A key element of this effort is to accelerate testing of innovative products and services to better serve these needs, according to USPS. While USPS is allowed to develop certain new postal products and services, there are statutory restrictions that currently limit the range of innovations USPS can offer. For example, under current statute, USPS is not permitted to ship alcoholic beverages. Similarly, although USPS is explicitly authorized to provide services to federal executive agencies (e.g., passport services), such authorization does not include services to state, local, and tribal governments. Legislation has been introduced in previous sessions of Congress that would permit USPS to deliver alcoholic beverages and allow USPS to provide property and services to state, local, and tribal governments under certain conditions. According to USPS officials, USPS supports these legislative proposals, which could enhance its ability to offer innovative products and services. According to USPS officials, two USPS handbooks include policies applicable to piloting key innovations. Specifically, the first handbook includes requirements, procedures, and responsibilities for all types of investment programs and projects undertaken by USPS, regardless of size, cost, or complexity. This handbook, for example, requires the identification and documentation of lessons learned for all investments and projects. The second handbook includes requirements and procedures specifically for major operating expense investments. This handbook, among other things, establishes requirements and procedures meant to ensure that new and enhanced products and services consistently meet customer needs, generate new revenue, and strengthen USPS as a business. This handbook further states that USPS has a responsibility to subject new initiatives to rigorous financial analysis, testing, and measurement, to determine whether these initiatives will make a positive financial contribution to the organization and ensure that USPS\u2019s leadership has appropriate information for effective decision- making. USPS\u2019s Office of Product Innovation generally has lead responsibility for piloting innovations. According to USPS\u2019s policies, a project manager is responsible for establishing and coordinating a cross-functional team to design and evaluate the pilot. This team typically includes officials from a variety of USPS departments, such as finance, general counsel, information technology, marketing, and operations. The project manager, with support from the cross-functional team, is responsible for preparing a proposal for the pilot that includes key information, such as the pilot\u2019s objectives and performance measures, and overseeing pilot implementation and communication with key stakeholders. In some cases, PRC has a role in overseeing postal innovation pilots. For example, USPS must notify PRC before it pilots any postal product innovation for which it will impose a price (i.e., a pilot that generates revenue for USPS) and must subsequently report quarterly revenue, volume, and cost data. PRC also ensures that certain safeguards are maintained during the pilot, such as limitations on the pilot\u2019s duration and revenue. However, according to PRC officials, the commission has limited involvement in other areas of USPS\u2019s efforts to develop innovations. USPS piloted 24 key innovations from fiscal years 2013 through 2017. For example, USPS piloted an Identity Verification Service that allows users to verify their identity either remotely (i.e., online) or in person at a postal facility. Similarly, USPS piloted an innovation to allow mailers to print shipping labels, track packages, and schedule package pick-ups by accessing USPS data. The primary goal of the majority of these key innovations (16 of 24) was to generate revenue, while the primary goal for the remaining innovations was generally to improve customers\u2019 experience using USPS products or services (see fig. 2). Appendix I includes a complete list of key innovations USPS piloted from fiscal years 2013 through 2017. The following discussion provides additional information about the 4 key innovations we selected as illustrative examples of USPS\u2019s efforts to pilot innovative products and services. Same-Day Delivery: From December 2012 to December 2015, USPS piloted same-day delivery for consumer e-commerce purchases (see fig. 3). According to the pilot proposal, this innovation was intended to generate revenue for USPS by allowing it to leverage its existing delivery infrastructure to capture part of the growing e-commerce market. To determine the potential scalability of same-day delivery, USPS first tested its operational feasibility and potential demand in several major metropolitan areas, including San Francisco, New York, and Phoenix. During the pilot, USPS delivered photos, chocolates, water, electronics, and other goods from 38 participating mailers to consumers in these areas. At the pilot\u2019s conclusion, USPS decided to continue offering same-day delivery to interested participating mailers under Priority Mail contracts. Grocery Delivery: From November 2014 to October 2017, USPS piloted a grocery delivery product in nine selected metropolitan areas. According to USPS, the innovation was intended to generate additional revenue by taking advantage of the growing market for grocery delivery. To test the innovation\u2019s operational feasibility, USPS required the pilot\u2019s sole participating mailer to bring totes containing groceries and other prepackaged goods ordered by customers directly to post offices (see fig. 4). USPS was then responsible for sorting the totes and delivering them to customers. According to its proposal for this pilot, USPS expected grocery delivery to provide a substantial revenue generation opportunity. At the pilot\u2019s conclusion, like same- day delivery, USPS decided to continue offering grocery delivery with the participating mailer under a Parcel Select contract. Informed Delivery: From spring 2014 through July 2016, USPS piloted a notification service called Informed Delivery in Northern Virginia and New York. According to USPS, this innovation is intended to bridge the gap between the physical and digital worlds by, for example, emailing customers with a scanned image of the exterior address side of letter-sized mail they should receive later that day (see fig. 5). Informed Delivery can also allow mailers to conduct marketing campaigns by integrating other elements\u2014such as hyperlinks to mailers\u2019 websites\u2014into the email and other notifications that customers receive. In its proposal to pilot Informed Delivery, USPS stated the pilot was intended to help USPS understand the service\u2019s business opportunity and increase the certainty of its potential benefits, which included retaining mail volume and generating new revenue from large advertisers. In addition, the pilot aimed to generate \u201cstatistically valid data\u201d on how subscribers respond to marketing campaigns that mailers conduct. According to USPS, more than 70,000 customers were actively using the service at the pilot\u2019s conclusion. In July 2016, USPS decided to end the pilot and launch the service nationally. According to USPS, about 13 million customers were subscribed to the service as of October 2018. USPS aims to have 40 million customers subscribed to the service by 2020. Keyless Parcel Lockers: Since October 2013, USPS has piloted keyless parcel lockers that allow customers to independently pick up packages in 98 selected post offices. According to USPS, among other things, this innovation is intended to reduce the number of missed package deliveries to customers\u2019 post office boxes and thereby reduce USPS\u2019s delivery costs (see fig. 6). The purpose of the pilot is to assess the performance and use of the lockers and to assess their performance. In October 2013, USPS began pre-testing the technical performance of 10 prototype keyless parcel locker units at post offices in New York City and Northern Virginia. Following this pre-test, in February 2015, USPS approved the installation of 50 made-to-order locker units in selected post offices across the country. Finally, in May 2016 USPS expanded the pilot to include an additional 50 units, including 2 units that a senior USPS official told us were not yet installed. As of November 2018, the pilot is still ongoing. USPS\u2019s policies applicable to piloting key innovations fully reflect two of the five leading practices for pilot design and evaluation that we identified in prior GAO work and relevant standards for internal control (see table 1). These policies do not, however, fully reflect the other three leading practices due to policy gaps. Further, we found that USPS had not consistently followed its policies to document lessons learned at the conclusion of each pilot, as discussed below. Senior USPS officials acknowledged that gaps exist in its policies for pilot design and evaluation because they were not developed by USPS to fully reflect all leading practices. These policy gaps limit the extent to which USPS can ensure that it is making good resource allocation decisions based on pilot experiences. Below we further discuss the extent to which USPS\u2019s policies reflect the five leading pilot practices we identified as well as how USPS applied these leading practices among the four piloted innovations that we reviewed. Establish appropriate and measurable objectives linked with identified performance measures: We found USPS\u2019s policies do not fully reflect this leading practice. While USPS policies require that project managers establish pilot objectives and performance measures, they do not require that each objective be linked with identified performance measures. As a result, some pilots may have objectives without an associated performance measure. For example, although USPS established both objectives and performance measures for each of the four innovations we selected for review, it did not consistently link each established objective to performance measures. USPS\u2019s proposal to pilot same-day delivery, for example, had objectives of generating new revenue and improving customers\u2019 experience. However, while the proposal included performance measures associated with generating new revenue\u2014i.e., package volume, gross revenue, and net revenue\u2014it did not identify and link any performance measures with its objective of improving customer experience. Similarly, USPS\u2019s proposal to pilot keyless parcel lockers included improving customers\u2019 experience as one of its objectives. However, while the proposal included a variety of performance measures\u2014reduction in the number of missed deliveries to post office boxes, locker rate utilization, and on-time locker installation\u2014it did not identify and link any performance measures with its improving customers\u2019 experience objective. Absent such measures, USPS may not know whether customers have experienced an improvement using keyless parcel lockers compared to using manual, keyed parcel lockers. Linking all objectives to performance measures could help ensure that USPS has the performance information to assess the extent to which a pilot has achieved all of its objectives. USPS officials told us that it can be difficult to measure performance for some objectives related to customer experience. While measuring customers\u2019 experience can be challenging, it is important to understand the extent to which a pilot has achieved all of its objectives. Further, USPS has demonstrated that it can measure improvement in customers\u2019 experience. For example, during its Informed Delivery pilot, USPS conducted a consumer survey with approximately 5,500 Informed Delivery subscribers to collect data on consumer adoption and satisfaction. In the survey, USPS found that over 80 percent were satisfied or very satisfied with the service. According to USPS officials, this data helped USPS to measure the pilot\u2019s success in meeting its objective of improving customers\u2019 experience. Articulate a methodology for evaluating pilot performance: We found that USPS\u2019s policies fully reflect this leading practice because the policies require officials to develop and communicate a methodology for evaluating pilot performance. Articulating such a methodology helps managers to identify the types and sources of performance information necessary to evaluate the pilot. USPS\u2019s policies require project managers to work with the pilot\u2019s cross-functional team to develop and reach consensus on the methodology. These policies also require the project manager and cross-functional team to identify data needs, data sources, and how the data will be evaluated. For the four innovations we reviewed, we found that USPS articulated a methodology for evaluating the pilot\u2019s performance. For example, for the Informed Delivery pilot, USPS identified its customer registration system as the method for tracking progress toward performance measures related to the number of Informed Delivery subscribers. Similarly, in its proposal to pilot keyless parcel lockers, USPS identified its central parcel locker monitoring system as a method of tracking progress toward performance measures related to utilization of keyless parcel lockers. Evaluate pilot performance and identify and document lessons learned: We found that USPS\u2019s policies fully reflect this leading practice, but USPS did not consistently follow its policy that requires documenting lessons learned. Specifically, the policies require project managers to evaluate performance and document lessons learned at the conclusion of each pilot. Doing so can enable USPS to identify information needed to make conclusions about the pilot\u2019s scalability and ensures that such information will be accessible to inform future related efforts. However, among the key innovations we selected for review USPS had not consistently documented lessons learned (see table 2). USPS officials told us that they discussed lessons learned during ongoing monitoring of pilot performance for these innovations, but had only documented lessons learned for its Informed Delivery pilot. Specifically, USPS identified lessons learned in its July 2016 proposal to launch its Informed Delivery service nationally. In this proposal, we found that USPS identified some lessons learned about the pilot related to user satisfaction and adoption rates. USPS officials told us that this information helped to inform USPS\u2019s decision to launch the service nationally. However, USPS officials acknowledged that USPS did not document lessons learned for the other two concluded pilots that we selected for review (same-day delivery and grocery delivery). Senior USPS officials told us that USPS had not consistently documented lessons learned at the conclusion of pilots across the 24 key innovations because it had not developed tools, such as a template, or training that could help ensure such consistency. Without consistently documenting lessons learned for all of its pilots, USPS risks losing information garnered during pilot implementation that could be relevant to future innovation efforts. Doing so can be particularly important because, according to a senior USPS official, officials responsible for pilot projects sometimes retire or leave USPS for employment elsewhere, creating a gap in knowledge of pilot experiences. Standards for internal control underscore the importance of maintaining documentation in order to retain organizational knowledge and mitigate the risk of having knowledge limited to a few personnel. Draw and document conclusions about scalability based on pilot results: USPS\u2019s policies do not fully reflect this leading practice. These policies require that project managers draw conclusions based on the results and lessons learned from the pilot. According to USPS officials, conclusions may include determining scalability\u2014i.e., whether, how, and when to integrate pilot activities into overall efforts. However, USPS\u2019s policies do not specifically require that officials document these conclusions. Documenting conclusions about scalability based on pilot results helps to ensure retention of organizational knowledge related to the pilot that may inform future decisions. Among the three innovations that we selected for review for which the pilots had concluded (i.e., same-day delivery, grocery delivery, and Informed Delivery), USPS officials told us that senior leadership discussed the results and lessons of the pilots and made determinations regarding whether, how, and when to launch them more broadly, but that they did not document these decisions or the rationale for them. By not documenting conclusions, USPS risks losing information that could affect the success of future related efforts and that could inform future USPS leadership of the rationale for maintaining investments in activities upon which pilots were based. Documenting conclusions for innovation pilots can be especially important in cases in which USPS decides to continue or expand pilot activities even when the pilots do not meet all of their intended objectives. For example, USPS\u2019s same-day delivery and grocery delivery pilots had revenue objectives, along with associated performance measures; however, neither pilot achieved these objectives. For the same-day delivery pilot, costs exceeded revenue in 12 of the 13 fiscal year quarters in which the pilot was conducted, according to data USPS reported to PRC. Likewise, USPS data indicate it did not reach its annual revenue target for its grocery delivery pilot. Similarly, USPS\u2019s pilot of Informed Delivery was intended to generate \u201cstatistically valid data\u201d on how consumers respond to mailer marketing campaigns. However, according to a senior USPS official, the pilot did not generate the data as intended, because no such campaigns were conducted during the pilot. As discussed earlier in this report, USPS did not discontinue any of these three selected innovations when their pilots concluded. Although USPS may have had good reasons to continue with, or more broadly launch, these innovations despite the pilots not meeting all of their objectives, the lack of documentation regarding its reasoning and decisions limits information relevant to whether USPS is making judicious use of limited resources. Ensure appropriate two-way communication at all stages of the pilot with key internal and external stakeholders in order to understand and address their views: USPS\u2019s policies do not fully reflect this leading practice. USPS\u2019s policies require the involvement of key internal stakeholders in pilots. Specifically, USPS\u2019s policies require the involvement of cross- functional teams\u2014which include legal, finance, and other departments\u2014 and varying levels of review during the design and implementation of pilot proposals. However, USPS\u2019s policies do not address communication with key external stakeholders. According to USPS officials, some pilot projects may be confidential or have limited or no direct effect on external stakeholders and, thus, communication with external stakeholders may not be appropriate. While external stakeholder communication may not be appropriate with some pilots, such communication, as appropriate, can help to ensure that issues critical to the success of a pilot activity are identified and addressed. Among the innovations that we selected for review, USPS officials explained various steps taken to involve internal stakeholders in the design and evaluation of the pilots, such as the involvement of cross functional teams to develop pilot proposals. Further, while USPS\u2019s policies do not address external stakeholder communication, we found that USPS employed strategies for some of the innovations we selected for review to communicate with some external stakeholders\u2014i.e., industry associations and mailers. For example, a representative of a postal association told us that USPS shared information and sought input about its Informed Delivery pilot during a quarterly meeting with industry groups. Similarly, a mailer we interviewed told us that USPS had shared information and sought input on the Informed Delivery pilot through direct outreach with the mailer. However, USPS did not consistently employ strategies to communicate with some key external stakeholders among the innovations that we selected for review. Specifically, USPS did not design or implement strategies to obtain feedback from consumers on its pilots for same-day delivery, grocery delivery, or keyless parcel lockers, despite the fact that each of these innovations directly affected consumers. In contrast, as previously discussed, for its Informed Delivery pilot, USPS planned and conducted a survey to obtain consumer feedback, the results of which helped USPS project managers support the proposal to expand the service nationally. Absent communication with all key stakeholders, USPS risks not having a complete understanding of perspectives that could inform the viability of its innovations. In recent years, USPS has sought to compete in a challenging business environment by piloting innovations intended primarily to generate revenue and enhance customers\u2019 experience. The policies that USPS uses for piloting key innovations fully reflect some leading practices for pilot design and evaluation, such as articulating a methodology for evaluating pilot performance. However, addressing gaps between USPS\u2019s policies and leading practices related to linking objectives and performance measures, documenting conclusions, and communicating with key external stakeholders would enable USPS leadership to better assess the outcomes of its pilots, understand the rationale for conclusions about scalability based on pilot results, and gauge customers\u2019 reactions to innovative products and services. Moreover, developing tools or training to ensure that USPS consistently implements its policy of documenting lessons learned from pilots would provide USPS with key information to inform future related efforts. We are making the following two recommendations to USPS: The Postmaster General should direct the Vice President of Product Innovation to develop policies that fully reflect leading practices for pilot design and evaluation in areas such as linking objectives and performance measures; documenting conclusions about scalability based on pilot results; and communicating with key external stakeholders, as appropriate. (Recommendation 1) The Postmaster General should direct the Vice President of Product Innovation to develop tools, such as a template, or training to help ensure USPS consistently documents lessons learned at the conclusion of pilots, as required by USPS policies. (Recommendation 2) We provided a draft of this product to USPS and PRC for comment. USPS provided a written response, which is reproduced in appendix II of this report. In its response, USPS did not state whether it agreed with our recommendations, but described actions that it plans to take related to each. These actions, if fully implemented, would meet the intent of our recommendations. For example, USPS stated that it would develop policies specifically for pilot design, and would reflect leading practices for pilot design and evaluation based upon best practice research. USPS also noted that it would develop training to ensure consistent documentation of lessons learned from its pilots. USPS added that this planned training would cover best practices for pilot tests. Regarding our first recommendation USPS said that pilots are only one step in a larger process for developing innovations. We agree with this and noted in our report that piloting is one key element of USPS\u2019s efforts to innovate. Nonetheless, given USPS\u2019s financial position, effectively piloting innovations is a critical step to ensure that USPS invests its limited resources on innovations that are most likely to improve its long- term viability. USPS also stated that flexibility is important in innovation pilots, particularly as it pertains to linking pilot objectives with performance measures. We continue to believe that linking objectives with performance measures is key to effectively evaluating pilots. In so doing, however, there is flexibility to adjust pilot objectives and performance measures as new information is gleaned during the pilot. Finally, with regard to communication with external stakeholders during pilots, USPS said that it communicates consistently with external stakeholders regarding pilots at Mailers\u2019 Technical Advisory Committee meetings (MTAC). In our report, we noted that USPS employed strategies to communicate with some external stakeholders\u2014i.e., industry associations and mailers. We continue to believe, however, in the importance of communication with all key external stakeholders, which may include stakeholders, such as consumers, that do not participate in MTAC meetings. USPS and PRC also provided technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate. We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional committee, the Postmaster General, Chairman of PRC, and other interested parties. In addition, the report is available at no charge on the GAO website at http://www.gao.gov.

    "human_reference": "USPS faces a challenging business environment that has led to reduced demand for its traditional services and significant financial losses. USPS aims to address this challenge by offering innovative products and services. The success of these efforts will depend, in part, on how effectively USPS tests each innovation's performance on a small scale to determine whether, how, and when to launch an innovation more broadly\u2014a practice known as \u201cpiloting.\u201d GAO was asked to review USPS's efforts to develop postal innovations. This report (1) describes key innovations that USPS recently piloted and (2) examines the extent to which USPS's policies reflect leading practices for pilot design and evaluation. GAO analyzed information on USPS pilots from fiscal years 2013 through 2017; compared USPS policies for piloting innovations to leading practices for pilot design and evaluation in prior GAO work and relevant standards for internal control; and selected four key innovations based on various characteristics (e.g., innovation type) to serve as illustrative examples of USPS's piloting efforts. From fiscal years 2013 through 2017, the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) piloted 24 key innovations intended primarily to generate revenue or improve customers' experience. The following four selected innovations illustrate these efforts: Same-Day Delivery: USPS delivered goods consumers bought online or in stores. The pilot sought to test the product's feasibility and revenue potential. Grocery Delivery: USPS delivered groceries to consumers in metropolitan areas. The pilot sought to test the product's feasibility and revenue potential. Informed Delivery: USPS emailed customers an advance image of the mail they would receive. The pilot sought to test the service's potential benefits, such as generating new revenue from advertisers that may use the service. Keyless Parcel Lockers: USPS is testing lockers where customers can independently pick up packages at post offices. The pilot seeks to test the service's operation and potential benefits for USPS and customers. USPS's policies for piloting innovations do not fully reflect the five leading practices for pilot design and evaluation identified in GAO's prior work. The policies fully reflect two of the leading practices because they require articulating a methodology for evaluating pilot performance and documenting lessons learned. The policies do not fully reflect the other three practices because they do not require: (1) linking pilot objectives to identified performance measures; (2) documenting conclusions based on pilot results; or (3) communicating with key external stakeholders, as appropriate. These policy gaps limit the extent to which USPS can ensure that it is making good resource allocation decisions based on pilot experiences. For example, GAO found that USPS did not document its conclusions based on the results of its pilots of same-day delivery, grocery delivery, and Informed Delivery. Documenting conclusions can be especially important when USPS continues to offer the product or service after the pilot has concluded, even though the pilot did not achieve all of its objectives, as was the case with these three innovations. Further, while USPS's policies require documenting lessons learned from its pilots, USPS did not do so for some pilots GAO reviewed. Senior USPS officials said that USPS did not consistently follow this policy because it had not developed tools or training that could help ensure such consistency. As a result, USPS risks losing information that could be relevant to future innovation efforts. GAO recommends that USPS (1) develop policies that fully reflect leading practices for pilot design and evaluation and (2) develop tools or training to ensure consistent documentation of lessons learned from pilots. USPS neither agreed nor disagreed with the recommendations but described actions it plans to take related to each.",

    "document": "Speaker 0: Great. Adam. 14.\nSpeaker 1: Report from Public Works, Parks, Recreation and Marine recommendation to adopt a resolution authorizing the city manager to execute a contract with game time for the purchase of playground equipment for a total contract amount not to exceed 546,000 districts one, four, six and seven.\nSpeaker 0: Great. And this is item 38. I know we want to do a short staff report because this is pretty exciting for those councilmembers I know that are getting the the new toy lot so Mr. West Marine Knight.\nSpeaker 2: Good evening, Mayor. Members of the city council. Yes, this is an exciting time for us because it's been a while since we've been able to replace so many.\nSpeaker 0: But we get tech services to have the presentation and the front, please. Thank you. Perfect. Continue.\nSpeaker 2: So the item before you tonight, there are four actually five playgrounds that are receiving measure funding. And the item this evening is for additional playground equipment that was not covered through a grant process for a Drake Park, Los Cerritos Veterans and Whaley. We're excited about these projects because what we are creating with these four parks is actually unique. Destination parks within are playgrounds within our park system. So each one of these four will have a different theme, and we hope that they will attract people from throughout the community to come to the different destination parks. So the plans include put in place rubber, surfacing new sand and play areas, ADA accessibility upgrades and some miscellaneous site furnishings like benches, hydration stations, etc.. So I'll run through the playgrounds. Drake Park Playground is going to be a butterfly garden playground with unique butterfly themed panels, some shade structures that will be in the shape of butterflies , vine climbers, nature benches, flower pedal steps and a log balance beam. So the hope is that children will want to go to the butterfly playground at Los Cerritos Park. It's going to be a treehouse and woodland theme with tree swings. It's going to have a zip line, hillside way of slides and a treehouse motif at Veterans Park. We're excited about this one because it's really more of a challenge obstacle course combined with a playground. So it really encourages children to do fitness while they're playing. They'll be climbing that structures a traverse, a freshwater floating boards and sway steps. So it is play equipment that really challenges kids. And I think it'll be a really exciting element for that park and then it really park. As you know, we have our day camp at Whaley Park, which is our theater and our Music Day camp, and that's very popular. So we thought this would be a great place to have a music themed and science themed play structure with colorful play flowers, twisted climbing nets, xylophones and chimes and hand drums and other musical elements added to the play equipment. And in addition, although tonight's item does not include the Fifth Park that we will be doing to measure a funding is Jackson Park. And so we have a small playground there at Jackson Park, and we'll be able to replace that playground as well with the measure of funding Jackson Park. It's sort. I didn't hear. Oh, sorry, I didn't hear the question.\nSpeaker 6: At the end.\nSpeaker 0: People were just people asking about the location.\nSpeaker 2: Oh, sorry. The timing. Because we did not want to take any of these playgrounds down during the summertime because kids are out of school will be starting in September. So we have up there for our veterans and Whaley. The project timeline, the big award will be in September. Construction will begin in October with a winter completion and draken lo cerritos. Better word will be October construction, November and completion in the winter as well. That is our brief staff report here for any questions.\nSpeaker 0: I'm going to have a motion in a second. But to turn to them in a minute, because I just wanted to thank your work on this. These five playgrounds will be probably the best five playgrounds we have in the whole city. And it's a start of of that measure piece that we set aside to redo playgrounds across the city and kids from across the entire city are going to enjoy these, which are going to be spectacular play areas for kids. And so I just want to ensure that we are moving along so that the community can see the results of their of their taxes and ensuring, as construction happens, that we're adequately signing the park so that people know that that their dollars are being put to work on these projects as well. I know that's in the works.\nSpeaker 6: As well, so.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you for that presentation. Councilmember Superfan.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you. And thanks to every night for also providing that timeline. That's the number one question we get. So if you could just reiterate that it makes perfect sense that you didn't want to impact the summer programs, you didn't want construction going on in high use times of the park. So for Whaley, at least, it's a fall project for the construction, as I understand it.\nSpeaker 2: That is correct. Okay.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Fall as in this fall or the next fall?\nSpeaker 2: No, this fall.\nSpeaker 0: Okay, good. These are going to be next fall for sure.\nSpeaker 2: With our partners in Public Works, these are all scheduled to be completed by the end of the year.\nSpeaker 0: Okay, that's that's good. Councilman Gonzalez.\nSpeaker 1: Yes? I just want to say thank you for these parks. Playgrounds. I think this is fantastic for all of us. And the very first thing, of course, Willmore asked for is when is the playground coming in? So there's this great timeline, and I appreciate the work for both of you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Councilman Price.\nSpeaker 8: This is fantastic. I love that there's distinct play areas that all the different parks and I think it's going to be great for the city moving forward. Do we have a plan of what the next priorities are for playground equipment replacement?\nSpeaker 2: So we have several other playgrounds that are in the queue for replacement. We just received the the housing and neighborhood grant from the state, and that's going to allow us to do two more playgrounds. So we've identified our playgrounds from the perspective of our health and safety needs first. And so we have a playground at Peace Park in the First District that is desperately in need of a redo. And so we're going to be able to do that with a grant. We also have a playground at Martin Luther King Park that will also be accomplished with that grant. And then we are continuing to look for other funding sources. We do not have anything identified in the second year of Measure A, and I don't believe the third year either for any future playgrounds. So we'll be continuing to look for outside grant funding to help us with that.\nSpeaker 8: I think that's great. I think that's a really good idea. And we've we've talked a lot about making sure that we have kind of modern facilities throughout the city and modern amenities for all of the residents. So to the extent that we can, even if we need to put up some matching funds, I think that's really important . But of course, the more we can enhance the areas that need it the most, the better. But if we can look at it from a citywide perspective, I think that would be great because I know that in some of the districts we've had some of the playground equipment fall apart and we've kind of, you know, improvised. So there's pieces that don't really belong, but they're, you know, kind of tacked on to a slide and different color and everything. And so that starts to look a little shabby. So if we can try to no reflection at all on Prime, you guys do an amazing job. But if we can start to think about how we can enhance all the playground spaces, that would be great and maybe kind of how how much they're utilized. And and that that might be a factor that we put into the prioritization as well in terms of what park are being most utilized. So thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilman Orson.\nSpeaker 3: Yes. This report and item is music to my ears. We've been advocating and working very hard to get new playground equipment at North Cerritos Park and Jackson Park and other parks for some time to councilmember price point. I think once these playgrounds are are put in place, it's going to kind of push the council to have to do more in terms of improving the quality of our playgrounds, throughout in parks, throughout our parks, because these playgrounds are going to set a new standard for play equipment in our city. And so thank you. Look forward to having some world class parks and improvement on what we have. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. And I think that it's a good you know, when the council starts discussing additional imagery dollars in the future. I also think I'm a I love putting money to playgrounds. I think that is one of the best uses we could do for emergency funds. And so we should talk about that, I think in the future. Any any public comment on this? Seeing none. Go ahead, members. Custer votes.\nSpeaker 1: Motion carries.",

    "document": "The MIECHV program provides voluntary, evidence-based home visiting services for at-risk eligible families with children up to kindergarten entry. HRSA allocates MIECHV program formula grant funds to states based partly on the proportion of children under age 5 living in poverty in each state, among other factors. In fiscal year 2018, states received an average of $6.9 million in MIECHV program formula grant funding, ranging from $1.2 million provided to North Dakota to $21.4 million to California (see appendix I for a list of all states and their fiscal year 2016 through 2018 funding). Generally, the state\u2019s public health or social services department is the lead agency that receives and administers the funds. States target MIECHV program resources to at-risk communities and have the flexibility to tailor the program to serve the specific needs of their communities. States are generally required to provide home visiting services using an HHS-approved evidence-based program model. Currently, HHS has determined through its Home Visiting Evidence of Effectiveness review that 18 evidence-based home visiting models meet HHS-established criteria for evidence of effectiveness, and are therefore eligible for MIECHV funding. States may select programs to implement from the models that have been approved by HHS, or states may choose to implement a home visiting service delivery model that qualifies as a promising approach, as defined in the statute. In MIECHV-funded home visiting programs, professionals meet regularly with families and provide services tailored to the families\u2019 specific needs, such as teaching parenting skills, promoting early learning in the home, or conducting screenings and providing referrals to address caregiver depression, substance abuse, and family violence. According to HHS, the MIECHV program builds upon decades of scientific research showing that home visits by a nurse, social worker, or early childhood educator during pregnancy and early childhood have the potential to improve the lives of children and families. From fiscal years 2013 through 2018, the number of families served and number of home visits conducted nearly doubled (see table 1). The MIECHV program is the primary federal program focusing exclusively on evidence-based home visiting, according to HHS. However, in addition to administering the MIECHV program, states may have other home visiting programs that may be supported by funds from other federal programs, such as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families and the Maternal and Child Health Services Block Grant. These home visiting programs may provide services that differ from those provided under the MIECHV program. For example, states may provide home visiting services through these programs that use program models that are different from the MIECHV program models approved by HHS. The MOE requirement in the MIECHV program\u2019s authorizing statute provides that funds provided to an eligible entity receiving a MIECHV grant \u201cshall supplement, and not supplant, funds from other sources for early childhood home visitation programs or initiatives.\u201d To demonstrate their compliance with this statutory requirement, states are required by HRSA to report in their annual grant applications their MOE spending for the prior fiscal year. HRSA provides guidance to states on how to report their MOE spending in the annual NOFOs. For example, since fiscal year 2013, the MOE guidance in the NOFOs generally has directed states to only report spending that meets the following criteria: paid for with state general funds, spent in the prior fiscal year on HHS approved evidence-based programs that include home visiting as a primary service delivery strategy, implemented in response to findings from the most current statewide needs assessment, and offered on a voluntary basis to pregnant women or caregivers of children from birth to kindergarten entry. Over time, HRSA has clarified the MOE guidance provided in the NOFOs to help address questions received from states, according to HRSA officials. We previously reported that certain grant design features affect the likelihood that states will use federal funds to supplement, rather than supplant (or replace), their own spending. One such design feature requires grant recipients to contribute their own funds in order to obtain grant funds. Requiring grant recipients to contribute their own funds can take the form of a match or MOE requirement. According to our prior report, matching grants typically contain either a single rate (e.g., 50 percent) or a range of rates (e.g., 50 to 80 percent) at which the federal government will match state spending on a particular program. An MOE requirement, in contrast, requires states to maintain existing levels of state spending on a particular program as a condition of receiving federal funds. Depending on the specific program and its MOE requirement, if a state did not previously spend any state funds on covered activities, then the state could be allowed to maintain MOE spending of $0. The MOE requirement is one of many MIECHV program requirements that HRSA is responsible for monitoring. HRSA also monitors MIECHV\u2019s programmatic and technical requirements, such as evidence-based model implementation, policies and procedures, data collection, and organizational structure and capacity. HRSA also monitors fiscal and administrative requirements, such as those related to accounts payable and cash flow, accounting systems, and cost allocations. From fiscal years 2016 through 2018, state-reported MOE spending varied from $0 to more than $25 million, according to our review of MIECHV program grant applications (see fig. 1). For example, 28 states reported MOE spending of $0 in fiscal year 2018. Most of the 23 states that reported MOE spending greater than $0 in fiscal year 2018 reported spending less than $3 million, while three states reported spending more than $9 million. See appendix II for each state\u2019s reported MOE spending for fiscal years 2016 through 2018. State-reported MOE spending does not necessarily reflect all state spending on all home visiting services. When states report their prior year\u2019s MOE spending on their MIECHV grant applications, they are only required to include home visiting spending if it meets the criteria specified by HRSA in the NOFO. In addition to reporting their MOE spending in grant applications, some states also noted that they spent funds on home visiting services that did not meet those criteria. In fiscal year 2017, for example, one state reported that it had spent funds on home visiting services for a non-evidence-based model (i.e., a model not approved by HHS), and the state also funded an evidence-based program with funds other than state general funds. However, the state did not include either in its reported MOE spending because that spending did not meet the criteria for MOE spending in the NOFO. An update to the MIECHV program\u2019s MOE guidance in the NOFO for fiscal year 2018 further impacted some state reported MOE spending. The update clarified the MOE guidance, stating that states should only report MOE spending by the recipient entity administering the MIECHV grant, and not report spending by other state agencies. According to HRSA officials\u2014because the states were now directed to exclude some previously reported home visiting spending\u2014five states decreased their reported MOE spending to $0. In addition, three other states reported a decrease in their MOE spending ranging from about $1.2 million to about $9.3 million because of this change (see table 2). HRSA determined that states generally met the MIECHV program\u2019s MOE requirement because there was no supplantation of federal funds, including in states that reported no MOE spending and those that reported decreased MOE spending from the prior fiscal year. States may be permitted to report $0 in MOE spending if the non-federal spending on home visiting does not meet the criteria in the MOE guidance in the NOFO. For example, if the state had not previously funded home visiting programs that met HRSA\u2019s MOE criteria for the MIECHV program, then the state could maintain state spending of $0, according to HRSA officials. States may report MOE spending of $0 if state general funds were spent on a home visiting model that was not approved by HRSA, if the state supports an evidence-based home visiting program with funds other than state general funds, or if the state did not support a home visiting program prior to implementation of MIECHV. HRSA determined that state-reported year-to-year decreases in MOE spending did not constitute supplantation (or replacement) of state funds with federal funds, because as described more fully below, HRSA determined there were valid reasons for the decreased MOE spending, according to agency officials. Based on our analysis of grant applications, 15 states reported decreases in MOE spending from fiscal years 2016 through 2018 (see table 3). These decreases ranged from $75,000 to $71,539 in one state, and $25,207,294 to $0 in another state. According to HRSA officials, there were three different reasons why states might have reported a decrease in MOE spending compared to the prior year: 1. The state made a technical error in its MOE calculation that subsequently was corrected. For example, some states reported a decrease in MOE spending compared to the prior year because the state previously included erroneous funding sources, such as funding for a home visiting program that did not meet the MIECHV program\u2019s MOE criteria. 2. Circumstances outside of the state agency\u2019s control contributed to the state reporting decreased funding, such as when a state legislature authorized budget cuts that affected home visiting funding or failed to pass a budget. For example, according to HRSA officials, one state experienced state budget challenges in fiscal years 2016 and 2017, which resulted in decreased funding for some home visiting services. The officials said this funding would have been included in the state\u2019s reported MOE spending and these budget reductions resulted in a reduction to the reported MOE spending from the prior year. 3. The clarification to the MOE guidance that HRSA made in the fiscal year 2018 NOFO limited the spending states should report, as previously discussed. HRSA uses several methods to monitor the MIECHV program and the program\u2019s MOE requirement is addressed to some extent as part of each, according to our review of HRSA grants monitoring documentation and interviews with HRSA officials. These monitoring methods include grant application reviews, site visits, and financial assessments, among others. The monitoring methods vary in terms of the extent to which the MOE requirement is specifically examined, who conducts the monitoring, and the frequency of monitoring (see table 4). The primary mechanism for monitoring the MIECHV program\u2019s MOE requirement is the review of grant applications, according to HRSA officials. HRSA project officers review the MOE chart in states\u2019 grant applications for 2 fiscal years to compare state reported MOE spending\u2014 actual non-federal expenditures\u2014and determine if states maintained their level of spending (see table 5). If there is a missing MOE chart or potentially inaccurate MOE spending information, project officers work with states to resolve the issue. While HRSA primarily relies on its review of grant applications to monitor state compliance with the MIECHV program\u2019s MOE requirement, the agency supplements these reviews with other monitoring techniques, and some of these techniques have identified issues with state-reported MOE spending. For example, operational site visits provide HRSA an opportunity to ask detailed questions about state-reported MOE spending and obtain supporting documentation. As a result of operational site visits, HRSA identified inaccurate state-reported MOE spending in some states. We reviewed four completed site visit reports from 2017\u2014the most recently completed reports at the time of our review\u2014and two of these reports had findings related to inaccurate state-reported MOE spending. For example, one site visit report noted that the state incorrectly included home visiting spending that did not use an evidence-based model in its reported MOE spending. HRSA also found some deficiencies with states\u2019 reported MOE spending through the agency\u2019s review of state single audits. According to HRSA officials, there were five state single audits with MIECHV MOE findings from fiscal years 2014 through 2017. We found that four of these audits identified deficiencies with how states monitored and accounted for their MOE spending. For example, one audit found that the state did not have internal controls in place to ensure that state spending met the minimum MOE requirement. In three of the four single audits that identified deficiencies, the state agencies concurred with the findings and prepared corrective action plans to address the deficiencies. As of June 2019, HRSA officials said they have taken steps, or are planning steps, to modify or provide additional guidance related to how the agency monitors the MOE requirement for the MIECHV program. Specifically: HRSA officials told us that beginning with the formula grant NOFO for fiscal year 2019, HRSA added an additional column to the MOE chart for states to provide the expenditures for the 2 years prior to the current fiscal year of the application. According to HRSA officials, this will streamline HRSA\u2019s process to compare state-reported MOE spending across 2 prior fiscal years without having to go back to the previous year\u2019s grant application. In February 2019, HRSA published an internal grants policy bulletin that specifically addressed MOE requirements and the agency\u2019s monitoring of those requirements for all HRSA programs. HRSA is currently working on MIECHV program standard operating procedures that are intended to clarify staff monitoring roles and responsibilities across the agency. Completion of this resource is targeted for the end of fiscal year 2019. HRSA is also planning to add the MOE table to future MIECHV program Final Reports submitted by grantees, beginning with the fiscal year 2017 Final Report, which is due to HRSA in December 2019. According to officials, this will allow for a formal resubmission of MOE spending if there have been any changes since the submission of the most recent grant application.

    "human_reference": "The MIECHV program provides grants to states to support evidence-based home visiting services for at-risk pregnant women and parents with young children. HHS was appropriated $400 million per year for the MIECHV grant program for fiscal years 2018 through 2022. Families volunteer to participate in the MIECHV program and are provided regular home visits and support services from a nurse, social worker, or other professional. According to HHS, the program builds upon decades of scientific research showing that home visits during pregnancy and early childhood can improve the lives of children and families. States began receiving federal MIECHV program funds in fiscal year 2010, but many states provided home visiting services prior to the MIECHV program using state or other funds. To meet the program's MOE requirement, states are required to maintain home visiting spending that meets MIECHV program criteria. GAO was asked to review the MIECHV program's MOE requirement. GAO examined (1) what is known about the MOE spending reported by states that receive federal MIECHV program funds and (2) how HHS monitors states to ensure the MOE requirement is met. GAO reviewed MIECHV program notices of funding opportunity for fiscal years 2013 through 2018 and state grant applications for fiscal years 2016 through 2018, the most recent three years available. GAO also reviewed HHS grants monitoring documentation and interviewed HHS officials. From fiscal years 2016 through 2018, state reported maintenance of effort (MOE) spending varied from $0 to more than $25 million for the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting (MIECHV) Program, according to GAO's review of MIECHV program grant applications. The program's authorizing statute requires states to meet an MOE requirement. MOE requirements in federal programs generally require grantees to maintain a certain level of spending to ensure grantee dollars are not replaced with federal dollars. To demonstrate their compliance with the MIECHV program's MOE requirement, states report in their annual grant applications their MOE spending for the prior fiscal year. HHS determined that states generally met the MIECHV program's MOE requirement because states did not replace state funds with federal funds, including states that reported no MOE spending or decreased MOE spending. States may be permitted to report $0 in MOE spending in certain circumstances; for example, if a state's only home visiting spending was on programs that did not meet MIECHV program criteria. According to HHS officials, state-reported decreases in MOE spending were due to errors in calculations that were subsequently corrected, clarifications to HHS's MOE guidance, or because of circumstances outside of the state agency's control. HHS uses multiple methods to monitor state compliance with the MOE requirement, according to GAO's review of HHS documentation and interviews with HHS officials. The agency's monitoring strategy includes reviews of grant applications, reviews of state single audits, and operational site visits, among other techniques. According to HHS officials, grant application reviews are the primary mechanism used to monitor state compliance, through which HHS compares state-reported MOE spending in grant applications across two fiscal years to determine if states maintained their level of spending. In addition, HHS identifies and resolves issues with state-reported MOE spending through its operational site visits and the agency's review of state single audits.",

Earlier Noah and Seinfeld had been photographed filming a segment for Seinfeld's acclaimed Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee online series. The pair were filmed walking around the DUMBO neighbourhood of Brooklyn and behind the wheel of a white Ferrari. Noah's very public appearance with New York Jewish comedy royalty comes not long after he was accused of anti-Semitism in the wake of his surprise promotion to Daily Show host. Cynics might wonder if Monday's very public appearance with Seinfield and David was a concerted move to combat that negative publicity but alternatively perhaps the comedian is undertaking a crash course in learning about American culture. His successor Stewart had an infamous obsession with the Mets that became a long-running joke on the Daily Show for over a decade. Noah, who is little-known in the US, rocketed to national fame last month after he was named as longtime host Stewart's replacement on the satirical news program. Earlier Noah and Seinfeld had been photographed filming a segment for Seinfeld's acclaimed Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee online series . Noah and Seinfeld were filmed walking around the DUMBO neighbourhood of Brooklyn and behind the wheel of a white Ferrari . However, the excitement surrounding the announcement was tinged by hundreds of internet users accusing the 31-year-old - who is a quarter Jewish - of anti-Semitism for a series of 'offensive' posts. The comedian quickly apologized and told his two million followers: 'To reduce my views to a handful of jokes that didn't land is not a true reflection of my character, nor my evolution as a comedian.' It comes as Comedy Central, which hired Noah as a correspondent on the show just three months ago, has defended its newest star as a 'provocative' comedian who 'spares noone, himself included'. In a statement, the network said: 'To judge him or his comedy based on a handful of jokes is unfair.' It added: 'Trevor is a talented comedian with a bright future at Comedy Central.' Noah, the son of a half-Jewish Xhosa mother and a Swiss father, drew fire for jokes that were described as tasteless, hateful, and unfunny. The controversial tweets were posted between 2009 and 2014. In May last year, Noah tweeted: 'Behind every successful Rap Billionaire is a double as rich Jewish man. #BeatsByDreidel.' Noah's very public appearance with New York Jewish comedy royalty comes not long after he was accused of anti-Semitism in the wake of his surprise promotion to Daily Show host . 'Not a true reflection': In a tweet earleir this month, Noah told his two million followers: 'To reduce my views to a handful of jokes that didn't land is not a true reflection of my character, nor my evolution as a comedian' A year earlier, he posted: 'Note to self - Langostines are not Jewish prawns.' Meanwhile, during a soccer match in January 2012, he joked: 'Messi gets the ball and the real players try foul him, but Messi doesn't go down easy, just like jewish chicks. #ElClasico.' He also slammed the United States' midsection in a 2013 tweet, writing that 'When flying over the middle of America the turbulence is so bad. It's like all the ignorance is rising through the air.' And in 2009, Noah, who can speak an impressive six languages, wrote: 'Almost bumped a Jewish kid crossing the road. He didn't look b4 crossing but I still would hav felt so bad in my german car!' On Tuesday, the tweets were being posted online by enraged bloggers, who slammed Noah as 'racist'. One said: 'Jon Stewart, born Leibowitz, won't be happy about these highly antisemitic tweets.' Stewart has voiced his full support for his successor, calling the incoming host 'incredibly thoughtful and considerate and funny and smart.' He promised that Noah 'will earn your trust and respect. Or not. Just as I earned your trust and respect. Or did not.' More seriously, he said if viewers give Noah the chance to prove himself, 'it's going to be well worth it.'",

    "document": "DON LEMON, CNN ANCHOR: OK. So polls show domestic terrorism has faded as a public priority in the year since 9/11. But domestic terrorism is back, front and center this week. For days we have been hearing about new terror plots and multiple arrests in different parts of the country, all apparently unrelated. In New York Afghan national Najibullah Zazi will be arraigned next week on charges that he conspired he used weapons of mass destruction, possibly on a subway in Illinois. Federal officials say an American named Michael Fenton tried to blow up a van he thought was loaded with explosives outside the state capital in Springfield. Officials say Fenton converted to Islam while in prison and that he idolized the American born Taliban fighter John Walker Lynne. There's also Dallas, where authorities say a Jordanian man drove a truck he thought was loaded with explosives into a parking garage under one of the cities landmark skyscrapers. He is due back in court on October 5th. Let's talk about these terrorist arrests now with Karen Greenberg. She is the executive director of the New York University Center on Law and Security. Thank you. Good to see you. What do you know about this new suspect that we have been talking about, about Najibullah Zazi. And there is a huge layout of him and his life in the \"New York Times\" today but what do we really know about him?</s>KAREN GREENBERG, NYU CENTER ON LAW & SECURITY: I think we know very little. What we do know is the Department of Justice and Law Enforcement authorities believe that this person represents, perhaps, the most serious threat to the United States in terms of terrorism since 9/11. We know that because the charge of conspiracy to use weapons of mass destruction is almost never used. In the over 800 terrorism prosecutions that have taken place in the country since 9/11, less than four percent have involved charges of intent to use weapons of mass destruction. And you would know the names - they would include Zacharias Musawi, Richard Reid. So that's an important factor that we have been told.</s>LEMON: Well, the question about all of this, when you have in so many areas in the United States, and also they are also tracing Mr. Zazi back to Pakistan where they say he had training in weapons and what have you. But the real question is, the evidence they have, will this hold up in court? Is it enough to prosecute someone for terrorism with just buying chemicals in a store?</s>GREENBERG: Well, I don't think they're worried just him buying chemicals. I think that they believe and we may not know why, and we don't know how this case is going to go. We don't know at all. But what they believe is that he had the knowledge of how to use these weapons and these chemicals, which is different than just buying them in a store. They think that they had somebody who had enough knowledge. This is not a bumbler as so many other terrorists and suspects have been portrayed when the case played those stuff out. They don't seem to put him in that category. And just to note, this is the kind of case that authorities around the world, particularly in Britain have been warning the United States about for quite some time now.</s>LEMON: OK. So listen, we've heard a lot again as we said about Zazi in New York. So how about the cases in Denver and in Texas, Illinois. How do they differ from Zazi's case out of New York?</s>GREENBERG: Those were different cases in that the main people and the only people, as I understand it, that these two suspects were in contact with were FBI officials who were posing as people who are sympathetic to terrorist plots. And they sort of found people who they thought were predisposed to commit terrorism. And they sort of planted them within a situation where they would plant the bomb in a place where it would go off. So, it seems to me a very different kind of scenario.</s>LEMON: OK. So these cases, real quick, I'm up against the break here. You said you don't think the government must know something, you believe, so hard to prosecute, hard to defend, these cases?</s>GREENBERG: I don't think Zazi is going to be that hard to prosecute although it might have been better if they let it play out a little longer. And the other ones might be easier to prosecute than prior ones like it in the past. Again, because they waited until these people thought were bombs were actually put into place.</s>LEMON: What about the defense in these cases?</s>GREENBERG: I think the defense is going to be challenging. And I think they will look to some of the British cases or some other cases for their defense strategies because these are different types of cases.</s>LEMON: Karen Greenberg, we appreciate it.</s>GREENBERG: Thank you.</s>LEMON: Well, they signed up to serve their country and ended up getting sick, but not on the battlefield. They are male U.S. Marines with breast cancer. Our special investigation is coming up next.",

And so I'm hoping that there can be some budgeting for some security because there's obviously remaining facilities we don't want vandalized because it's a very important structure. And I want to thank the city manager and city staff. This has been a long, long process, but I think it's one that's going to serve the city of Long Beach very well. It's going to save the city tremendous amount of money because we are going to have an east side police station where we don't have to pay rent. And I think it's going to be a valuable asset for the community.

    "document": "Speaker 0: All right. Thank you. Thank you so much for that. And then, councilor, we're going to slide.\nSpeaker 4: Right into.\nSpeaker 0: My item. And not my item are item 11, which are my nominations to the Commission on Persons with Disabilities. And I am happy to report that I have three impressive nominees and I just want to give shout out my appreciation to our community. I am just overwhelmed by the amount, the quality, the quantity and quality of applications. I'm getting to all of our boards and commissions. These decisions aren't easy. I'm really touched by people's commitment. They just desire to serve their community, to lend their time and talents. So what I'm doing, my recommendations are that we reappoint two of the incumbents and then appoint a new individual. And so whenever incumbents is Lisa Hall Lisa has a wide range of experience with disability issues, including from a personal basis, from working with a parent. She has done a lot of work with our less privileged individuals for many years, found Christ Episcopal Church as food bank program and does work with our Rantoul community and she has served a term on the commission with persons in just with a commission on persons with disabilities would like to serve in others. She is one of my nominees and the next nominee is us. And this is in no particular order. It's in the order in which they were interviewed. Jennifer Rohloff is another incumbent and Jennifer has a brother. Her younger brother has special needs, lives in a group home in the area. But Jennifer, from a young age, in part because of her commitment, in part because her mother was a teacher in the school district, she was actually called upon and agreed to be a tutor in special ed classes when she was in elementary school. She remembers tutoring in Neil Tam's special ed class, and Mr. Tam is a revered educator. Then the late Neil Tam, his friends and family are still in the that community, but he was a special ed teacher before he became a principal. Jennifer has served on the board of class in house, which trains and provides employees with special needs folks that serve you at Safeway and other other establishments. And she's said she is a very passionate advocate for persons with disabilities. And then my third and newbie appointee is named Katie Beeler. And Katie is well, I'll just give you a little, little background. She actually applied to serve on the library board, but I was so, so taken with the description she put in her her application that I reached out and said, would you possibly consider serving on the Commission of Persons with Disabilities? Arranged for her to meet with Sarah Henry, our public information officer, who also staffs that commission. And so she's Katie Bieler, who works in the publishing industry. In particular, she is project manager on global literacy and education for a company, an independent publishers group, where she oversees publications for persons with reading challenges , whether they're visually impaired, have dyslexia, ADHD. And she says that after 15 years in the publishing industry, my passion for equitable access to information led me to my current role, where I create software products for people with print reading disabilities. She's currently the president of the Bay Area Women in Publishing. She also has a master's degree in Jewish art and in visual culture from the. Jewish Theological Seminary of America, as well as bachelor's degree in History of Art from University of Michigan and another and another bachelor's degree in anthropology from University of Michigan. And she's excited to join this commission. So that's just an introduction. At our next meeting, we'll have a chance to vote on their nominations, but I just wanted to introduce them to you. Thank you, all of you, everyone who applied and those who were nominated. And we look forward to voting on your nominations next week. So thank you very much. And now we will move on to item three. And item three is proclamation, special orders and announcements. And there are two proclamations, one I'm going to read this evening. The other one will will be posted on the website and go in the record. But I wanted to read our proclamation recognizing declaring September 15 through October 15, 2021 to be National Hispanic Heritage Month. So here's our proclamation.",

    "document": "An eight-year-old boy was taken to hospital after falling victim to a prank when he was suffocated until he passed out. Police in Manchester have now issued a warning to parents over the game, known as 'sleeper', which officers say is potentially fatal. The child's details have not been release but a Greater Manchester Police spokesman said the child is believed to have had underlying health problems and is expected to make a full recovery. Officers from Greater Manchester Police have been forced to issue a warning on Facebook (pictured) after an eight-year-old boy was hospitalised after a playground suffocation prank called 'sleeper' went wrong . The 'sleeper' prank involves a child having their nose and mouth held shut by another child\u00a0until they black out from lack of oxygen. The youngster was treated in hospital on Wednesday after they were a\u00a0'sleeper' victim, police said. Officers in North Manchester believe it is a new craze and have alerted\u00a0parents. GMP's North Manchester division posted on their Facebook site after the\u00a0incident: 'Dangerous New Craze Warning - Attention all\u00a0parents/guardians...We have received reports of a new craze called\u00a0'Sleeper' This involves children completely covering the mouth and noses of\u00a0younger children until they completely pass out. Manchester's city centre chief councillor Pat Karney (pictured) has said the craze must be stopped 'before we have a tragedy on our hands' 'This is extremely dangerous, a child is currently in hospital being\u00a0treated after falling victim to this game. Please advise every child you\u00a0know and warn them of the dangers, this could easily lead to concussion or even death. The post has now been shared more than 11,200 times on the social network. GMP's Facebook post received a flurry of responses from followers, some\u00a0claiming the game dates back several years. Tasha Williams replied: 'This was happening when I was at school although\u00a0it was someone pushing on your chest really hard or on your throat, it is a\u00a0stupid game.' Linzi Walker added: 'It's not new it's been going for years and years.' But Pete James said: 'Only buzz I used to get as a kid was putting a\u00a0crushed carton in the back wheel of my bike and making it sound like a\u00a0motorbike! What's wrong with kids??' Stuart Roberts worte: 'Are the children of today total numbnuts??' Sebastian Ziola added: 'Back in my day, we played Pogs. Oh how times\u00a0change.' A senior council boss in Manchester has issued a stark warning about the craze. Pat Karney, councillor for neighbouring Harpurhey ward, told the Manchester Evening News: 'This news will put the fear of God in any parent or guardian. 'I will be talking to the council officers in the area to see how we can provide more information and warnings to local schools and parents. 'It has to stop before we have a terrible tragedy on our hands. The problem is that when kids hear about an incident like this, it goes viral in an instant in today's world. Officers in Manchester (GMP headquarters pictured) believe 'sleeper' is a new craze and have alerted parents .",

    "document": "KEILAR: A monster cyclone hits halfway around the world, and the death and devastation are staggering. Our T.J. Holmes is tracking the story from our international desk. T.J., what can you tell us?</s>T.J. HOLMES, CNN ANCHOR: Hey there. This is always a busy place, as we know, Brianna, around the international desk. But specifically today a lot of talk over here about Myanmar and the cyclone that hit, specifically this section here. This is where a lot of the work has been coming in. And a lot of the information has been coming in about this, up to 10,000. This really threw us off, all of us, really. We were watching this storm over the weekend, and we heard about hundreds being killed. And then just this morning it jumped to 4,000. And now we're being told up to 10,000 people could be dead in this thing in Myanmar. Certainly, the deadliest natural disaster to hit there in recent history. The capital there, Yangon, got hit for more than ten hours, really, on Friday night and also into Saturday. Twenty inches of rain dumped there. Look at some of these pictures you're seeing here. It sank boats in the Yangon Harbor, shut down the airport. Roofs coming off houses, bridges washed out, uprooted trees, you name it. Just a disaster there. Here's some of the daytime pictures you're seeing, as well. Myanmar, you don't maybe hear about it that much in the news, day in and day out. However, it may sound familiar to you, because it was in the news in a major way just last year. It's known as Burma there, and it's under military rule. Been that way since a coup in 1962. But thousands of students and Buddhist monks took to the streets last August to protest that military government there, known as the military junta. It responded with a violent crackdown there. You might remember some of the pictures of monks being arrested. Ten protesters are killed as well. Back to this disaster we're dealing with here now. We're getting information -- tough to get a lot of information out, but a lot of it is coming online. We've got a Web site we've been keeping an eye on, called the Democratic Voice of Burma. Burma also what Myanmar is known by. The government opposition Web site here, it's talking about phones being down, difficult to get independent accounts of the casualty numbers and damage that's going on. Whole towns, according to this Web site, have been washed away. And little details like this, saying that the zoo was badly damaged and that animals are pretty much running amok, is how they describe it. And also something we've been hearing today, is how the price of fuel, the price of food has just shot up. According to this Web site, water there will cost you about $90, $90 U.S. a bottle. Also gas costing about $1,200, U.S. dollars for a gallon of gas. Some of the quotes we're getting from this Web site we can tell you about here. People that are dialing into this particular Web site, talking about \"We're facing drinking water problems. Now people are buying water from fire engines. The prices for food and drinks have gone up. The price of rice has gone beyond 30 kyat for a bag.\" Also, another one here we have for you, saying that \"The tin roof of every house is overturned. We are in trouble. We have nowhere to stay. We have no water. We have no electricity. Every household is in trouble.\" And finally here, one more here we can show you, from this Web site, again, this opposition party Web site, saying that \"Electricity won't come within 10 to 15 days. People are starving. Fuel is becoming scarce. If international help doesn't come this week or within a week it will be impossible to survive.\" So we have this major disaster, talking about 10,000 possibly dead. But it could get worse, and more could be killed if relief does not come. I do have an update I can give you. Here are folks on the international desk, have been giving to me. Now there are some relief agencies there in Myanmar, but they have very limited supplies and they have very small operations. Doctors Without Borders is there. The Red Cross is there. They are working on the ground right now. But those supplies are going to run out and run out fast, given the need that is happening there. So the word here from our international desk is that the -- Thailand is going to be sending supplies. It's the first country that's going to send a wave of supplies, first foreign country. And those supplies hopefully will get there very soon. But they are going to be sending the first wave of supplies to arrive. The major issues they have, Brianna, right now, three, it's three-fold: shelter, water, and medical supplies. Well, the shelter is going to be sent through plastic sheets and blankets for people to cover up. The water, purification tablets also in those medical packs. So the relief is coming, Thailand the first to get on. And also, we hear, Brianna, that Laura Bush is going to be making a statement about this crisis, humanitarian crisis, coming up from the White House around 3 p.m. Eastern Time. Laura Bush has been outspoken about some of the protests and the rule there of the military junta there. So she has been quite involved in what's happening in Myanmar, or Burma, again, as it's traditionally known as. So we expect to hear from her at 3 p.m. -- Brianna.</s>KEILAR: That's right. Unusually outspoken, she has been, about what happened in Myanmar recently. Thank you, T.J. Holmes at the international desk.</s>HOLMES: All right.</s>LEMON: All right. And you heard now -- you heard T.J. talk about aid and aid organizations going over to help in Myanmar. The U.N. and private aid agencies rush to prepare assistance for victims of the devastating cyclone in Myanmar. And one of those agencies is UNICEF. Joining us now is Patrick McCormick. He is a spokesman for UNICEF. You have to wait for government approval. I understand you have gotten it. It is not official yet, but you have the paperwork, and you are moving to get teams into place to go help.</s>PATRICK MCCORMICK, SPOKESMAN, UNICEF: Yes, we understand there's been a formal request for assistance from U.N. agencies. So we're taking that as a green light and we're going ahead.</s>LEMON: We're hearing that you're working with other agencies, including the Red Cross. And as I understand, you have about five teams -- am I correct -- that are going to go into Myanmar to distribute this aid?</s>MCCORMICK: We have five teams already going around the country taking a look at the damage and what needs to be done. We pretty much know what we need to get out there, as soon as possible. I think you mentioned it before, it's shelter, water. There's a desperate shortage of drinking water. And medicines. And it needs to get there very, very soon, especially for the children which -- who are always the most vulnerable in these situations.</s>LEMON: Yes. You are used -- obviously, your organization is used to dealing with these sort of things. And I mean, we heard them talk about how much drinking water costs now. It is at a premium. There is no food. There's no shelter. And people can't even talk by phone. The cell phones are down. You're saying that, of course, the children need to get food and water. But explain to us, going into a situation like this, what you're prepared for and what you're prepared to see on the ground. Ten thousand people, that's a lot of deaths.</s>MCCORMICK: Yes, 10,000 people dead. And many, many more affected. And you know, I think this is going to be at least as big as the cyclone that hit Bangladesh. And in Bangladesh we got a lot of help from the governments. We used their helicopters, which we're going to need this time -- that's for sure -- because the roads and access routes in Myanmar are very difficult at the best of times.</s>LEMON: What can people, if people are watching here on CNN and they're thinking, \"Well, maybe I'd like to do something or there's nothing that I can do in this situation. I'm so far removed from it.\" What would you recommend that they do, Mr. McCormick?</s>MCCORMICK: They should get in touch with us U.S. Funds for UNICEF, and I don't have the number on me. I rushed to the studio. But they can Google it. Or I think it's on this CNN Impact Web site.</s>LEMON: OK.</s>MCCORMICK: And that's where they should go.</s>LEMON: All right. Just explain to us what your folks, your representatives on the ground, are they reporting back to you what they're seeing?</s>MCCORMICK: Absolutely. Yes, we've been in -- I don't know how many telephone calls I've already had. We can get through on some lines. They keep dropping. But we're in constant touch with them.</s>LEMON: What are they saying?</s>MCCORMICK: They've saying, well, they've never seen anything like it. The devastation -- you can see the pictures -- is widespread. And you can imagine what it's like for the hundreds and thousands of families who are living amongst uprooted trees, maybe cold, getting hungry. The children are scared. And we need to help these people as soon as possible.</s>LEMON: Yes, OK. Yes, that sort of describes it for us. Patrick McCormick from UNICEF, thank you very much. And we wish you very best of luck there and, of course, always appreciate UNICEF helping out around the world.</s>MCCORMICK: Thank you.</s>LEMON: Well, less than 24 hours until the polls open in North Carolina and in Indiana. Who has the momentum heading into tomorrow's crucial Democratic primaries? Our roundtable will crunch the latest numbers for you. A look ahead this tight Democratic race.",

But now a growing number of liberals are angry with President-elect Obama saying he's leaving them out in the cold especially on some significant cabinet appointments as well as policy priorities. Tim Carpenter is national director of the Progressive Democrats of America. Thanks for being with us this morning, Tim.</s>TIM CARPENTER, NATIONAL DIRECTOR, PROGRESSIVE DEMOCRATS OF AMERICA: Good morning. Thank you (ph) for the opportunity.</s>CHETRY: Well, you know, former -- today, former Vice President Al Gore is going to be meeting with Obama to talk energy, also climate issues. But Democratic officials say Obama is not looking at Gore right now for a cabinet level post or perhaps any position in the administration, and that Gore isn't interested in it. Is that something that liberals and progressives would like to see, Gore with an active role in this administration?</s>CARPENTER: Well, sure. I think he'd be a wonderful appointment for secretary of energy. But I think those days are behind Al Gore now. I think he's now an international ombudsperson to really work on these issues and it's certainly rising above a cabinet position. Our hope that the closing days, weeks here with Barack's final appointments, we see some real progressive -- authentic progressive voices that will be appointed to the cabinet. We know that Al Gore won't be one of those, but there's many possible candidates whether it be the secretary of interior. We would hope maybe that the Barack Obama transition team would look at Raul Grijalva, Congress member out of Tucson, who knows the issues of the earth and environment, worked very hard in Congress, attending (ph) the occupation, a single pair advocate. He's somebody we would like to see nominated or secretary of agriculture, maybe Jim Hightower. There are certainly plenty of good candidates out there.</s>CHETRY: You know, it's interesting, this net groups and groups like that raised so much money for Barack Obama. Is there a feeling that he sort of owes them in a way to at least represent some of their positions and issues that they hold dear?</s>CARPENTER: Well, I think some of our friends on the blogs are a little over the top, may we say. I think it's important to maybe keep our powder dry a little bit. We're definitely a</s>CHETRY: Chris Bowers from Openleft.com wrote, \"Why isn't there a single member of Obama's cabinet who will be advising him from the left?\" And in a message to liberal critics, Obama's deputy campaign manager, Steve Hildebrand, wrote, \"This is not the time for the left wing of our party to draw conclusions about the cabinet and White House appointments that President-elect Obama is making. After all, he was elected to be the president of all people not just those on the left.\" Does that feel like you're being hung out to dry a little bit?</s>CARPENTER: No. I don't think we're about to dry thinking those two extremes you just painted. We're kind of in the middle right now. I think Chris is doing a good job through Open Left to keep him honest. We're trying to do the same thing. But at this point in time, we're not done appointing the cabinet yet. Let's give Barack Obama the benefit of doubt and hope whether it'd be secretary of energy or secretary of interior, secretary of agriculture, that he will get us one authentic progressive voice. And Chris is doing a good job to keep that heat on. But by no means it's a time to throw Barack Obama under the bus. He hasn't even assumed the presidency yet.</s>CHETRY: Right.</s>CARPENTER: We had no real illusions that he was going make a number of appointments early on in regards to progressive, but we're not done yet. And we keep coming back to kind of a teaching moment we refer to. When FDR was first elected, we need to remember when he met with the progressive community and they asked him to move in a certain direction, he challenged the progressive community to go out. That he agreed with them but that he challenged us to go out and really bring those issues to the forefront and I think Barack is doing the same thing.</s>CHETRY: And what do you define as the difference between progressive or liberal?</s>CARPENTER: Well, it's, you know, we don't probably have enough time on the show. It's the nuance. But progressive tends to be those of us that are working for real change. Working at the root cause to bring about real change, change that will affect this country in a meaningful way. Change that we're talking about is redirecting military spending to meet human needs, to really cut the military budget in this economic crisis to put it to work to make sure that the 47 million Americans this morning that are waking up without health insurance have real health insurance. When we say progressive, we want to work to let people know that government is our friend and that government can work for us. We want to see a bailout that benefits Main Street not just Wall Street. So when we say progressive, we're working at the grassroots level to make sure that our government's accountable and working for all of us. Not just the special interests and not just those inside the beltway.</s>CHETRY: I got you. Well, you're taking a wait and see attitude. Some others, as you said, are keeping up the pressure a little bit more. Tim Carpenter, the national director of the Progressive Democrats of America, thanks for joining us this morning.</s>CARPENTER: Thanks so much for the opportunity.</s>ROBERTS: Coming up now at 30 minutes after the hour and here are this morning's top stories. Hundreds of buildings torched, dozens of people hurt after three days of nationwide riots in Greece. Protesters hit the streets after police shot and killed a teenager there. Schools are closed today for his funeral. The sit-in continues this morning in Chicago after factory workers took over their former place of business. Yesterday's talks broke down without a deal. They're going to try again today. Two hundred laid off workers have taken turns occupying the factory since last week when it abruptly shot down and fired them. They say Bank of America, which took bailout money, cut off the factory's financing and left them without severance packages. Senator Hillary Clinton made her first trip to the State Department since being tapped by President-elect Barack Obama to be his secretary of state. Clinton met with the Obama transition team and also had dinner with the current secretary of state Condoleeza Rice. And who better to get details on the meeting than our own state department correspondent Zain Verjee.</s>ZAIN VERJEE, CNN STATE DEPARTMENT CORRESPONDENT: I wasn't invited.</s>ROBERTS: Yes but I know you work your sources inside the building. And you know exactly what went on. So what happened?</s>VERJEE: Well, Hillary Clinton is really just diving into the transition, as we know. She had dinner with Secretary Rice, one on one. They met at Rice's apartment in Washington, D.C. and, you know, John, Rice makes a mean fried chicken but on the menu last night America's crises and how to handle them. No one knows yet exactly what was discussed but probably the importance of having the trust of the president, Senator Clinton, John, was also at the State Department the first time too. Meeting her transition team and getting fully briefed. John.</s>ROBERTS: It would be nice to know too if Secretary of State played piano for the incoming secretary. She's very good at that, is she not?</s>VERJEE: She is. She's an amazing professionally trained piano player. She loves playing Brahms. And you know , what Secretary Rice has done is to really want to make this a smooth transition.</s>ROBERTS: Yes. I mean other than giving her piano lessons what else is the state department doing to help out Senator Clinton?</s>VERJEE: Well, they want to make it as painless as possible so that when Senator Clinton takes over she doesn't miss a single beat. The state department has given her team office space, support staff to help with any questions they may have so they can find answers and deliver them, things like transition papers. They got a briefing book. They've also instructed ambassadors around the world to write a status report of their countries so that she's completely up to speed along with her team. I mean, one of the major priorities is really going to have to fill out some of those key positions at the state department and people I talked over at state say there's a bit of nervousness John in the corridors. People are worried about who she may bring. And so, you know, it remains to be seen. And many say that she really got to work hard too at building the trust of the professional foreign service officers.</s>ROBERTS: We'll see. You ever tried that fried chicken, Zain?</s>VERJEE: No but I love fried chicken.</s>ROBERTS: Still have a little more than a month to try?</s>VERJEE: I don't know maybe after a month, I'll get to try some of that fried chicken.</s>ROBERTS: Zain Verjee for us this morning. Zain, thanks so much.</s>VERJEE: You're welcome.</s>KIRAN CHETRY, CNN, ANCHOR: It's not easy to get right but when you do it's delicious. Well when it comes to formal affairs it doesn't get any bigger than this. In 42 days when Barack Obama takes office, political junkies won't be the only ones watching. Of course, the entire fashion world is going to be looking to see what the first family is going to be wearing at the inauguration and our Lola Ogunnaike has been getting a preview of both what Barack Obama, the president-elect will be wearing and of course, his wife the incoming first lady. So let's start with Barack Obama. Isn't a tux just a tux? No offense to the guys out there.</s>LOLA OGUNNAIKE, CNN ENTERTAINMENT CORRESPONDENT: You know, a tux is just a tux. But this is a special tux because it's an American-made tux. It's from a company called Hart Schaffner Marx. That's been around for well over 100 years and it's based right out of Chicago. So he's going with a home town team and it's also very union friendly. It's one of the first companies to have a relationship with a union that dates back to 1911.</s>CHETRY: So these are the things, these are the considerations that have to be made, right? It has to be a politically correct tux.</s>OGUNNAIKE: Fashion is political, especially this season. And if you think that's an accident it's not. He's been wearing their suits since the summer time to all of his major events. So he's probably likely to go with these guys.</s>CHETRY: Going with the bow tie and not the straight tie?</s>OGUNNAIKE: Bow tie and he's going with the one button on the suit. Very simple. Very classic. If they indeed do dress him the suit will cost probably a little less than $1,000 which is also reasonable considering it's the biggest day of his life and he could have blown thousands. But he decided to do something that is really moderate.</s>CHETRY: I got you. All right. Michelle Obama? She, of course, has the harder decision to make, if you will, because there's designers all over the place who want to dress the first lady. So what are her options?</s>OGUNNAIKE: They are clamoring to work with her. And since it looks like Barack is going - I'm sorry Obama, excuse, I don't know him that well. Obama is going with a Chicago based brand. She may go with a Chicago base brand too. One of her favorite designers is a this woman named Maria Pinto. She dressed her in the purple dress with the shift, the evening that he secured the nomination. She also dressed her in the green dress that she wore the night of her Democratic National Convention speech. So she's been a favorite so far. But again designers are clamoring to work with her. \"Women's Wear Daily\" invited a number of designers to submit sketches for dresses.</s>CHETRY: Let's check a few of them out.</s>OGUNNAIKE: I think they are gorgeous. Isaac Mizrahi submitted his sketch. Michael Kors. Oscar de la Renta, Betsey Johnson and they really took time and it's clear that this is something they are taking very seriously. With the red one, that's the Monique Lhuillier which is gorgeous. This purple one is an Isaac Mizrahi number. And so, it's clear - this woman is probably going be one of the most viewed woman in the world. The Betsey Johnson one is a little aggressive. I don't think she'll go with the red, white and blue dress. I think she might stay away from that.</s>ROBERTS: That red one with the draping -</s>CHETRY: Yes. Gorgeous.</s>ROBERTS: I mean I know nothing about fashion. I just know that that looks nice.</s>OGUNNAIKE: What do you think? You like the Monique Lhuillier in the red?</s>CHETRY: Yes.</s>ROBERTS: I thought that was really pretty.</s>OGUNNAIKE: I like the Michael Kors one with the tight belt and the little shoulder moment. I think that could be cute as well. So we'll see.</s>ROBERTS: It just shows how easy it is for guys though. As you said, you can wear the same suit that he's worn all year. You know the single button thing with a tie or bow tie. Look at me. I'm wearing a tie today. Can you believe it?</s>CHETRY: No, no but you can get really -</s>OGUNNAIKE: Tie or no tie.</s>CHETRY: He has these gorgeous cufflinks on. Monogrammed.</s>ROBERTS: I think these came from a viewer.</s>CHETRY: Did they open?</s>ROBERTS: I needed some cuff links today.</s>CHETRY: And there's a picture of me in there. So cute.</s>OGUNNAIKE: That's great. A little and call it a day.</s>ROBERTS: This showed up on my desk with no note or anything. I think they came from a viewer. So thanks very much. I needed cufflinks today.</s>CHETRY: They're gorgeous.</s>OGUNNAIKE: The small touches, the subtle touches for a man. And you are a fashion icon yourself, John Roberts.</s>CHETRY: He is.</s>OGUNNAIKE: So why don't you call Obama.</s>ROBERTS: Thanks, Lola. On to more important things. Barack Obama says he can create jobs and fix America's infrastructure all at the same time. So exactly what is that going to take? Our Chris Lawrence has got the answer in today's \"Memo to the President.\" And Bayer in search of the next pandemic.

The committee recommends the bill pass.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilmember Bagshaw.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you very much. And thank you to Seattle Public Utilities that came to our committee the last month and provided us with the information about the stormwater code. The bill passed unanimously out of our committee under the Federal Clean Water Act's Municipal Stormwater Permit. Seattle and similar municipal governments are required to periodically update regulations for stormwater practices and facilities. This ordinance includes three immediate changes that save the city money while still controlling pollution and complying with ecology requirements and those requirements. They include a number of specific projects, but they're going to make our water quality treatment thresholds for the roadway projects equivalent to ecology thresholds. They will exempt from Seattle public utility drinking water pipe projects from water quality treatment and green stormwater requirements consistent with the ecology requirements. And will also allow our Seattle Public Utilities Director to designate areas through a director's rule where new development may be exempt from the code's stormwater flow control requirements. Because the city drainage system has sufficient capacity to handle any increases in flow related to the development. I know that sounds very exciting to those of you who haven't been participating in it, but it's a very exciting project that I appreciate ESP moving forward on. So we will achieve equivalency with the Ecology 2014 Stormwater Manual. There have been many stakeholders involved in this over the last two years and we recommend do pass.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you.

    "document": "WOLF BLITZER, CNN ANCHOR: Thanks very much, Anderson. A full night here at the Republican National Convention at Madison Square Garden. Tonight, among the speakers we'll be seeing on the agenda tonight, Zell Miller, the Democratic Senator from Georgia. He'll be speaking here endorsing the president. Lynn Cheney the wife of the vice president. She'll be introducing her husband, Dick Cheney. He's the featured speaker tonight. During the 10:00 pm Eastern hour, a full plate of Republican activity at Madison Square Garden.</s>ANNOUNCER: America Votes, 2004. This is CNN's live coverage of the Republican National Convention.</s>BLITZER: Thanks very much for joining us. I'm Wolf Blitzer at Madison Square Garden. The president of the United States is now in New York City. He's on the ground. He was in Ohio earlier today. He's here in New York. He'll be addressing this convention tomorrow night. The vice president will be doing that duty tonight. The vice president in a motorcade, heading over here, as he has been doing every day since this Republican Convention opened. Joining me in our coverage, as always, Judy Woodruff and Jeff Greenfield. What do you expect will be the most important thing the Republicans will have to do tonight?</s>JUDY WOODRUFF, CNN CORRESPONDENT: What they've got to do tonight, wolf, is begin, for this third night in a row, to sell George W. Bush to the American people. How do they do that? With his running mate, Dick Cheney. Here is somebody who doesn't have the most favorable approval ratings in the world, and he's someone who there was a lot of speculation that he might come off the ticket. But here we are with two months to go. George Bush says this is the man I want at my side. And Dick Cheney has simply got to make the case that George Bush is the man to be reelected.</s>BLITZER: Jeff, what do you think?</s>JEFF GREENFIELD, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: I think Dick Cheney is in one of the most unusual positions we've seen in politics. The very fact that he is not likely to run for president because of age and health has helped all the other Republican wannabes back off and let him, with the president's full support, become the single most powerful vice president ever, in effect the prime minister, someone who does draw the lightning, who is one of the less popular figures in the administration and someone who was never going to be dumped from the ticket in a large measure, because in many ways the conservative for the Republican party think he is their man, whether it's on the use of force in Iraq, on social issues. So Dick Cheney really comes here, I think, less to sell George Bush to a skeptical public than to reinforce things about George Bush and also to try to redefine Dick Cheney, not as this kind of Dr. Strangelove figure hiding in an undisclosed location, but a hunter, a fisherman, a good husband, a good father, another nice guy.</s>BLITZER: Let's bring in Andy Card, Andy Card, the White House chief of staff who works with Dick Cheney, dare I say, every single day of the year.</s>ANDY CARD, WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF: Every single day.</s>BLITZER: He's been among the most active vice presidents and influential vice presidents, I believe, in history.</s>CARD: He has. Now, understand that Dick Cheney had been a chief of staff. He'd been the secretary of defense. And now he's been the vice president for the last 3 and three-quarter years and he's done a spectacular job. And the president picked Dick Cheney to be at his side in case anything should happen to George W. Bush. He knows that Dick Cheney would be able to lead this country. But Dick Cheney is not looking to lead the country. But if he had to, he could. And that's what this is all about.</s>BLITZER: Will we see a different Dick Cheney tonight, should we say, a kinder, gentler Dick Cheney than the perception, at least, that has been out there?</s>CARD: Well, Dick Cheney is a kind and gentle man who is a strong leader. He has great conviction. He's a terrific vice president because he is so supportive of what the president does. He's a real team player. But Dick Cheney is a very kind man. He's a wonderful, wonderful husband, a great father, a great grandfather. He's just been a really terrific person. All around this country people love him. He does understand the outdoors. He understands the West. He understands what it means to have a strong leader in the White House. And that's why he wants President Bush reelected.</s>WOODRUFF: Andy Card, has the relationship between Dick Cheney and George Bush changed over the last almost four years? I mean, initially, as Jeff said, there was a lot of talk he's the prime minister, he's pulling the strings behind the scenes. Now I think there's less of that perception. George Bush has been in the job. How do you see their relationship changing?</s>CARD: Well, Vice President Dick Cheney understands who the president is. And the president is the president. The vice president is not. The vice president is not the prime minister. We don't have one in our government. But the vice president does understand how Congress works because he was a member of Congress. He's been very helpful as we deal with Congress and work to get legislation passed in a very divided Congress, both the House and the Senate. He also has been terrific at understanding what it means to conduct a war. After all, he successfully helped President Bush, former President Bush, conduct the war in the Gulf, and that was a tremendous success.</s>GREENFIELD: Andy, this business about nice guy and good guy, Ed Gillespie says we've got to show the president's a good guy, now we want to show the vice president as a good guy. I'm going to be blunt about this. Why the heck should the voters care whether somebody's a nice guy as opposed to whether, for instance, he played games with military intelligence and got us into a bad war with Iraq or is pushing an agenda that is dangerous to the environment? Wouldn't it be irrelevant if he was the nicest guy in the world if his policies and judgment were no good?</s>CARD: Well, I can the you their policy and judgment is great. And they are also good guys, and they're fun to work with. And they work very hard, and they care about the things that people in America care about. You know, Dick Cheney is kind of a bottoms-up person. He started off right down there in Wyoming. He and his wife were in the same high school. They were good friends. He went to Yale. Then he went back to Wyoming. He's a great guy, and he knows what it is to struggle in this country and then to succeed.</s>GREENFIELD: But my point is Winston Churchill wasn't a nice guy, and he was born affluent. And Franklin Roosevelt wasn't the best father and husband, and he was born rich. They were both great leaders. Why should we even care about that?</s>CARD: I don't know that we have to care about it, but it does make a difference. And I can tell you, it's a good thing for me that both the president and the vice president like each other, number one. I don't have to separate them. Number two, they're both good guys, and I enjoy talking with them and sharing counsel and getting advice.</s>BLITZER: It's important, Jeff, because that's what voters like. They want the president and the vice president in addition to being smart and strong, they want them to be nice guys as well.</s>CARD: They want them to get along. And they do get along.</s>BLITZER: The Democratic presidential nominee today, John Kerry was at the American Legion convention in Nashville, Tennessee. He made some very serious charges against the president and the vice president. Among other things, \"I would have never gone to war without a plan to win the peace. The president has now acknowledged he had a miscalculation, didn't plan appropriately for what he called a catastrophic success, the speedy destruction of Saddam Hussein's regime. And look what's happened, a lot of American troops have died over the past year.\"</s>CARD: Well, the war was such that we got to Baghdad faster than the pundits predicted and it was much easier for us to go into Baghdad and to secure that facility around which Saddam Hussein had his palaces and everything else. Saddam went hiding in a hole, and the public was left in anarchy. And the United States came in very quickly and provided leadership and guidance to get them out of the anarchy. It's been a struggle, but it's the right struggle. But the victory came very quickly on the ground war. And we did get to Baghdad faster than most pundits had predicted.</s>BLITZER: What did the president mean when he said there was a miscalculation?</s>CARD: Well, I think there was an expectation -- there were many expectations that did not materialize. One is we thought there would be starvation. There was no starvation. We thought there would be a lot of refugees. There were not a lot of refugees. We thought that we'd have problem with unrest from, kind of, the military and then we'd have the civil workers ready to do the job. And they weren't ready to do the job. The Baathist regime was more involved in everyday activity in Baghdad than probably many of us had thought possible. So we did have challenges that we didn't expect, but we also had successes that we didn't expect.</s>WOODRUFF: Let me ask you about something else that happened today. Karl Rove, who's the president's chief political adviser gave an interview to the Associated Press in which, among other things, he said that John Kerry tarnished the reputation of all those American soldiers who fought in Vietnam with his opposition to the war and the accusations that he made. The Kerry campaign has come back and said, in fact, Merrill McPeak (ph), the former Air Force general said \"who the hell\" -- and I'm quoting him -- \"who the hell is Karl Rove to comment on what John Kerry did?\" They're calling for Karl Rove to step down, to resign from office.</s>CARD: Well, I assume that General McPeak and the others who served in the armed forces have all been fighting to defend our Constitution and protect us. And one of the aspects of our Constitution is free speech. And Karl Rove exercised his constitutional right to speak.</s>WOODRUFF: But do you think -- do you agree that by what John Kerry did, he tarnished...</s>CARD: Well, you know, I've known John Kerry for a long time, and I have great respect for anyone who wears the uniform in the armed services, especially I have respect for those who sacrificed and earned a Purple Heart. And John Kerry wore the uniform. He sacrificed and earned a Purple Heart.</s>BLITZER: All right. Andy Card, hold on one second. I want to go to the floor. They're just making it unanimous the nomination of the vice president of the United States and the president, of course, President Bush. Right now, that's Michael Steele the lieutenant governor of Maryland. Let's listen in.</s>MICHAEL STEELE, LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR OF MARYLAND: The chair proudly announces that this convention's unanimous choice for the office of president of the United States is George W. Bush! We can do better than that! We can do better than that. George Bush, George Bush! Come on, now. Bring it home for the president. All right.</s>BLITZER: All right, so they're celebrating here. It's official, it's unanimous. George W. Bush the unanimous, the unanimous selection. What a surprise, Andy Card. We had expected -- maybe we'll still see -- the president's supposed to be in Queens addressing a group. Let me call it specifically, the Italian Charities of America hall in Elmhurst with firefighters. Is he going to make a remote appearance here?</s>CARD: It's my understanding that he is watching as he's won that nomination, and he'll be ready to beam into this convention hall. But I have also been down on the floor for the last hour and-a-half, so I don't know if the satellite truck showed up.</s>BLITZER: I'm sure if the president wants a satellite truck and the Bush/Cheney campaign wants it, it'll show up.</s>GREENFIELD: Andy, while we wait perhaps for your boss to show up, job figures are supposed to come out, I think, at the end of this week. Advance word is they are not going to be good. Candidly, is the economy not the soft underbelly of your reelection effort?</s>CARD: Well, I actually feel that the president put a solid foundation, and the economy and is building on that foundation. It was a foundation of tax cuts, and it was a foundation that had to correct for the corporate governance scandal that we had. And all of that made for an opportunity for to us grow. I actually think the jobs numbers will still show growth, so we won't dip into the negative range. They will show growth.</s>GREENFIELD: My question, though, is that's still the biggest obstacle you have to reelection, no?</s>CARD: We're not going to be happy until everybody in America who wants a job is able to get a job. And we won't quit.</s>BLITZER: If the president makes his acceptance speech -- of course he will make the acceptance speech tomorrow night, but what is he going to do if you do get this hook-up with the firefighters in Queens? He's going to say what?</s>CARD: Well, I think first of all, he's going to be thrilled that he's won that nomination. And he'll say I'm ready to come to that convention hall. And you're going to hear a great speech tomorrow night. But he's got a hopeful speech for America. You know, it's not going to be talking about the past. It will talk about the foundation he's laid for success and optimism. He's a leader that will take us to a better place.</s>BLITZER: How do you feel about all the criticism that Zell Miller, the Democratic senator from Georgia, is getting? You probably don't remember, but maybe you do. In '92, right here in Madison Square Garden, he was speaking very, very strongly against the first President Bush. Now he's endorsing the second President Bush. They call him zigzag.</s>CARD: Well, I tell you, he respects strong leadership. And Senator Zell Miller has been a careful observer of the president during times of challenge for this country. And he's come down on the side of saying, George W. Bush is the right leader for the time.</s>BLITZER: Andy Card, you've got a long night ahead of you. You've got a big day tomorrow. Thanks very much for spending a few moments with us.</s>CARD: Thank you. Judy, Jeff, thank you.</s>WOODRUFF: Thanks, Andy. We appreciate it.</s>BLITZER: And we'll look forward to hearing from the president if, in fact, that's going to happen. We'll find out if that satellite truck showed up. I suspect if it didn't show up, someone is going to be in deep, deep trouble. We've been speaking a lot about Zell Miller. At 10:00 p.m. eastern, he's going to be speaking the key note address, highly unusual for a Democrat to be doing that at a Republican convention. CNN's Dan Lothian has been taking a closer look at Zell Miller. And CNN's John King has been taking a closer look at the vice president of the United States, the two prime speakers later tonight. First, let's get behind the scenes and what made Zell Miller endorse this president.</s>DAN LOTHIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): His critics call him zigzag Zell. Senator Zell Miller has danced with both political parties and in between. Now the Georgia Democrat is in step with President George Bush, a key voice from the other side, trying to inspire not only conservatives, but moderate Democrats.</s>SENATOR ZELL MILLER, UNITED STATES SENATE: The world was changed as far as I'm concerned by 9-11. And I want a president now that's got a little [inaudible] in his craw (ph).</s>LOTHIAN: Seventy-two-year-old Miller is a former mayor, state senator, lieutenant governor and governor of Georgia. He's independent, outspoken, and sometimes downright different. Miller once sent a truckload of Georgia onions to Capitol Hill and passed them out to every senator, along with a recipe for onion soup, a small taste of the senator's colorful southern style. He once ranted on the Senate floor about Kid Rock's controversial flag-draped performance at the Super Bowl.</s>MILLER: He should be tarred and feathered and ridden out of this country on a rail.</s>LOTHIAN: But it's Miller's high profile role in both parties and seemingly changing views that have drawn so much attention, praise, and criticism. In 1992, he gave the keynote speech at Bill Clinton's nominating convention, also at Madison Square Garden. At that time, Miller spared few words in criticizing Clinton's opponent, former President Bush.</s>MILLER: Americans have seen plants close down, jobs shipped overseas, and our hopes fade away as our economic position collapses right before our very eyes. And George Bush does not get it.</s>LOTHIAN: He also blasted the Republican party.</s>MILLER: We can't all be born rich and handsome and lucky. That's why we have a Democratic party.</s>LOTHIAN: But Miller has often shot from the hip. And in this campaign, a different view. Miller criticized Senator Kerry, began supporting the president on key issues and joined Bush on the campaign trail.</s>GEORGE W. BUSH, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: He puts his country ahead of the political party.</s>LOTHIAN: Miller's new allegiance has prompted Georgia's Democratic party to launch this Web site.</s>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There was a time when Zell Miller did get it.</s>LOTHIAN: The senator on the record, then and now.</s>BLITZER: Dan Lothian, reporting on Zell Miller who is going to be one of the major speakers later tonight. Another major speaker, the vice president of the United States himself. Our senior White House correspondent, John King, has been taking a look at the vice president of the United States and has this report.</s>JOHN KING, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Wolf, it might be a surprise for some around the country to see a Democratic senator up here promoting the Bush/Cheney ticket tonight. No surprise at all to see the vice president when he enters this hall tonight. But back early in this political season, there was rumbling about in Washington among some Republicans who thought the president should get somebody younger, somebody more dynamic to share the ticket. President Bush quickly stepped forward and put that talk to rest, saying no, if he gets four more years, he wants Dick Cheney by his side.</s>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: In an iffy economy, every purchase helps. And what a coincidence. Pennsylvania just happens to be a November showdown state. No, cows don't vote, but their owners do, and rural communities tend to be a little more conservative, which suits Dick Cheney just fine.</s>DICK CHENEY, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: President Bush and I will also continue to defend our society's fundamental rights and values. We stand for a culture of life, and we reject the brutal practice of partial birth abortion. And we will defend the individual right of every American to bear arms.</s>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Courting conservatives is one campaign role. Leading the attacks on the opposition another. This is a staple.</s>CHENEY: America face as choice between our president and a man calling for us to fight a more sensitive war on terror.</s>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This one tailored to auto making Michigan.</s>CHENEY: Throughout his 20 years in the Senate, John Kerry has supported unreasonable fuel standards for American cars and trucks. Analysts say the cafe standards supported by Senator Kerry would cost up to 450,000 American jobs.</s>KING: Like his boss, the vice president is a polarizing figure. Forty-four percent of Americans have a favorable view of him, 45% unfavorable. To the president, and other conservatives, he's a trusted voice of experience, from taxes to terrorism.</s>BUSH: Though he's not the prettiest face on the ticket. I didn't pick him for his looks. I picked him because he can do the job.</s>KING: To Democrats, the vice president is too eager to flex military muscle, too cozy with big energy companies and their poster child for an administration they portray as cold-hearted.</s>SENATOR JOHN KERRY (D-MA) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: They think we ought to cut life saving medical research and even homeland security. And if you think that's compassionate conservativism, then Dick Cheney is Mr. Rogers.</s>KING: But it is not always so black and white.</s>CHENEY: Lynn and I have a gay daughter.</s>KING: In a rare public disagreement with the president, the vice president makes clear he does not support a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage.</s>CHENEY: States have made that basic fundamental decision in terms of defining what constitutes a marriage.</s>KING: But for the most part, he and the president have been in sync. Before the war in Iraq, his were the most dire warnings about Saddam Hussein.</s>CHENEY: The issue is not inspectors. The issue is that he has chemical weapons and has used them. The issue is that he's developing and has biological weapons. The issue is that he's pursuing nuclear weapons.</s>KING: No such weapons have found in Iraq, but don't come to a Cheney event expecting an apology.</s>CHENEY: In Iraq, of course, not only is Saddam Hussein no longer in power, today he's in jail, which is where he ought to be.</s>KING: Flashy is not a word that comes to mind, but he is loosening up as a campaigner and seems at ease in the small town settings where the Bush campaign believes the election will be decided.</s>KING: At first glance, this stop might seem ill advised for candidate with a history of heart trouble. But look closely and listen to his spouse who helps both with message and menu discipline.</s>LYNN CHENEY, VICE PRESIDENT'S WIFE: Such willpower.</s>CHENEY: It's hard (ph).</s>KING: A salad at McDonald's there for the vice president. Look for a little red meat in the hall tonight. He will try to be more personal, perhaps more friendly, try to boost his own personal standing with the American people. But make no mistake, Wolf, he also will deliver a crystal clear contrast, saying President Bush has been decisive as a commander-in-chief and should stay the course in the war on terrorism. And in the vice president's view, he will tell the American people John Kerry is anything but decisive and has a 20-year record soft on national security issues -- Wolf.</s>BLITZER: John, by all indications, his health is strong right now, given the fact he's had a series of heart attacks under those circumstances. There's no indication of any serious medical problem beyond what we know, is there?</s>KING: No, he has routine checkups for his heart. And if you get off the Cheney plane and you travel with him, if you look back a few second after you get off the plane, you usually see his exercise bike brought off and put on the tarmac. He tries to ride a little bit every day.</s>BLITZER: All right. John King reporting on the vice president of the United States. He'll be the principal speaker coming up tonight. CNN's Candy Crowley is in the Florida delegation. What's happening there?</s>CANDY CROWLEY, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, this is one of the occasions and we have them along the way where two stories collide. Now that another big storm appears to be heading toward Florida, what you're seeing here is a divided delegation weighing whether do we go home now, batten down the hatches, ride out the storm. Bit what they really would like to do is hear George Bush speak tomorrow night. So we are told by delegates here that some people are, in fact, going home. They do need to go home because there's one woman here whose pets are being taken care of by someone else, some evacuation is going on. She needs to go home. But by and large, they're going to stay here, though they are monitoring back home very closely. On a political note. They do agree here, some that our producer, Sasha Johnson, has talked to have head said, listen, you know, how the Bushes -- that is, Governor Bush and President Bush -- respond to these storms is going to be important. Because as you know, Wolf when Charley came through, it hit very Republican areas. You want to keep these folks happy in particular. But the entire state, they give George Bush and Jeb Bush, no surprise here, a very high marks for their handling of the first storm. But they admit that with the second one coming, this is something that they look at but they first look at home, property and lives. So a little split delegation here as they try to figure out what to do and watch the weather map as well as the podium. Wolf?</s>BLITZER: Hurricane Frances a very, very serious problem for Florida. Already in Palm Beach County, 300,000 people along the coast have been told perhaps tomorrow to start evacuating that area. Carlos Watson, our political analyst, is from Florida. Carlos, as we see Don King, the boxing promoter, on the floor of this Republican convention. More about him later. Two hurricanes within a matter of a few weeks within Florida, potentially sets the stage for some serious political ramifications.</s>CARLOS WATSON, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: It certainly does. Certainly more visits by the president by John Kerry, more of an opportunity to spread help in the form someone called largesse from FEMA in order to help people get back on the ground. But, Wolf, I'll tell you, what's happened in Florida this week, three dramatic things that many people may have missed. One, Ralph Nader seemed to qualify to be on the ballot. That could be big news for John Kerry. Number two, Mel Martinez a Cuban-American Republican, won the nomination. That could help President Bush increase turnout. And last but not least, when you look at the turnout numbers from yesterday's primary, they were up, Wolf, 33% over where they were four years ago. If that is right, we may end up not just in Florida, but across the country with the highest voter turnout we've seen since 1968. I'm talking some 56, 57 percent of the voting age population turning out. And Dick Cheney may be a big part of that when it comes to the Republicans. They'll use him in a number of ways and in a number of states in order to turn out the base.</s>BLITZER: Carlos Watson, thanks very much. Judy, all this Florida talk, Jeb Bush, the governor of Florida, the brother of the president, he has important business down there and helps explain why he decided not come to this convention.</s>WOODRUFF: Absolutely. They've had one storm come through, they're facing another one. Wolf, I want to add something right here about this whole turnout question. The people of Florida, especially Democrats, have said that they are not going to let happen again what happened in 2000. It wasn't that long ago that Karl Rove -- and we just heard about this the other day. When he heard the Democrats had registered something like 150, 175,000 new voters in Florida, he turned around and found out Republicans had only registered about half that. And he said let's gear up Republican registration efforts. This is turning out to be a battle of new voters, a battle of registrations. It's just one part of why we're going to be watching Florida very closely in the next few days.</s>BLITZER: Very briefly.</s>GREENFIELD: Wolf if you want to know why this hurricane matters so much, John Lindsay, mayor of New York, almost lost his job in 1969 because a snowstorm crippled part of the city. Mayor Blandvick (ph) of Chicago did lose his. Weather can be the most significant part of how people feel about their leaders.</s>BLITZER: In Florida, the weather is going to be very significant by all accounts over the next few days. We're going to take a quick break here. At the Republican National Convention, we're standing by. The president of the United States is in Queens, meeting with firefighters, watching this convention. We expect he's going to be beamed in to this convention momentarily. We'll be right back.</s>BLITZER: Madison Square Garden, the Republican National Convention. Let me tell our viewers, what we're standing by -- there he is, the president of the United States in Elmhurst, New York. That would be in Queens. He's meeting with firefighters, specifically Uniformed Firefighters Association members. They're watching the convention from there. He only got into New York a short time ago from Ohio, that important battleground state. The president, we expect might be saying some words to this convention momentarily. The firefighters, Judy and Jeff, something that the Democratic presidential nominee has been using extensively as a base of support here.</s>WOODRUFF: Wolf, the union that came out front and center, four square, whatever you want to use the term behind John Kerry, first was the International Association of Firefighters, Harold Shaitberger, something like 270,000 members across the country. They came out early for John Kerry. They worked for him hard throughout the primaries, and they're working for him now. But just this week, right here in New York City, one of the firefighters unions with 8,700 members, the union that you're going to see tonight, the United Firefighters Association, are endorsing George W. Bush. There's another Firefighter Officers Union. You can say why does it matter? It's become a turf thing to some extent. It's, you know, 8,700 members in New York. They lost over 200 firefighters on 9-11. The other union lost over 100. You know, whenever you talk to firefighters and police New York City...</s>GREENFIELD: First of all, they're the heroes of 9-11. Second of all, they represent one of those Democratic groups, traditionally Democratic groups, blue collar, unionized, public employees, many of whom have moved in the uniformed services to Republican. This is the same kind of turf that Bill Clinton fought very hard for in 1992, when he was surrounded by policemen to overcome the soft on crime issue. Firefighters are like domestic soldiers. And to have them as another symbol of strength, a symbol of traditional values, traditional heroism, it's understandable why both candidates want that image so much.</s>BLITZER: Let's go upstairs. Donna Brazile and Victoria Clarke, two of our analysts. Donna Brazile, the former campaign manager for Al Gore's campaign four years ago. Victoria Clarke worked in the Bush campaign four years ago, went on to become the spokeswoman over at the Pentagon. First to you, Donna Brazile, is the president stealing some of John Kerry's thunder by sitting down with firefighters, getting this endorsement in Queens tonight?</s>DONNA BRAZILE, CNN ANALYST: Well, you know, Wolf, there's an old saying, it's not what you sit, it's where you stand. And on those issues, John Kerry has stood up for firefighters. He's standing up for first responders. He will get their strong support this fall.</s>BLITZER: What about that, Victoria Clarke. This is shaping up as somewhat of a little sideshow, but somewhat significant, given the heroic role that firefighters play every day, especially 9-11.</s>VICTORIA CLARKE, CNN ANALYST: Absolutely right. But I'll tell you, I met some of those firemen a few years ago, right after 9-11. I've seen some of them since then, some of the policemen. And I've talked to some of the policemen in New York since I've been here. I think there are an awful lot of them that are big fans of the president.</s>BLITZER: Donna Brazile, let's talk about Senator Zell Miller. He says he's still a Democrat even though he's endorsing and will be the keynote speaker tonight at this Republican convention. How do you explain his change? He says he hasn't changed. What he says is the Democratic Party has changed.</s>DONNA BRAZILE, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Well, you know, Wolf, if you go back and look at the speech he gave in 1992, endorsing Bill Clinton, serving as the keynote speaker, you know, he could come into this convention and really give that same speech to the Republican Party has grown out of touch with mainstream values. But Zell Miller is staying good-bye to the Democratic Party. I don't know if he's ready to say hello to the Republican Party. But if this is his -- his swansong, then good-bye, Zell. So long. We have a lot of great conservatives in the Democratic Party, along with moderates and liberals. We all get together. We stand together. We fight together for the values that the American people care about. And I know John Kerry and John Edwards will be proud tonight to know that there are many other Democratic senators, conservative, liberal and others who will continue to stand by them this fall.</s>BLITZER: Victoria Clarke, what do you think?</s>VICTORIA CLARKE, FORMER PENTAGON SPOKESPERSON: Well, I've seen him quoted as saying he was born a Democrat, and he's going to die a Democrat. So he's not ready to be pushed out of the party yet. I think it's just another sign of the remarkable depth and breadth of opinion and political persuasion you're seeing coming out here and supporting the president this week.</s>JEFF GREENFIELD, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: If I may?</s>JUDY WOODRUFF, CO-HOST: Yes, go ahead.</s>GREENFIELD: Donna, you know, the thing, though, Zell Miller has stayed with the party and its candidates, long after other conservative Democrats, starting with Strom Thurmond in 1964, fled. Doesn't this bother you a little it's a sign that there's increasingly no ground left, at least in the South, where conservative Democrats are willing to stand with their nominee?</s>BRAZILE: Well, there's a lot of conservative Democrats who are still standing with their nominee and will be running this fall as Democrats. We have a lot of great candidates who will be seeking reelection under the Democratic banner. And look, I went back home to Louisiana to support one of them in 2002 and she got reelected. So this is Zell Miller. Somehow or another he's grown uncomfortable with the Democratic Party. But look, he's now standing behind a party that cannot create one job, that cannot provide healthcare, that have left the -- those who are unemployed and impoverished behind. So if that's the party that Zell wants to join, then they should go ahead and give him a lifetime membership.</s>WOODRUFF: Tori -- Tori, I guess my question to you is does Zell Miller have the kind of credibility that matters when, again, at the Democratic convention 12 years ago, he was calling George Bush's father, the first President Bush, somebody the public couldn't trust. He had gone off in the wrong direction. If he was right then, how can he -- how can he be right now?</s>CLARKE: I think he's got an awful lot of credibility. But, you know, to Donna's point, this isn't going to come down to one person or endorsement. But if you look at what's been going on this week, people who have disagreed with the president about different things, people who have run against the president in the past, all these people, including Democrats, have come together this week to say, \"All things considered, we think President Bush is the guy.\" That's pretty powerful.</s>BLITZER: All right. Victoria Clarke, Donna Brazile, we'll be getting back to both of you.</s>BRAZILE: Thank you.</s>BLITZER: Let's go down to the Georgia delegation right now. CNN's Dana Bash is down there. This must be strange, Dana, for a lot of Republicans in Georgia. They're about to applaud very enthusiastically for a Democrat.</s>DANA BASH, CNN CORRESPONDENT: That's exactly what they're saying here, Wolf. The folks here certainly are very happy that Zell Miller is going to be here. But they say that it was really hard for them to imagine having one of their -- a Democrat at one of their conventions to be the person giving them the red meat against the Democratic candidate. This is somebody that they have run races against for 40 years. So certainly, they are very excited that he's going to endorse their candidate. But Zell Miller is somebody, Wolf, who was a state chairman for Walter Mondale, not exactly a liberal, as we just heard. Miller is somebody who now says the Democratic Party is too partisan, that they have lost their way on foreign policy. The Republicans think that his message can resonate with conservative Democrats; hopefully vote, they hope for George Bush after listening to Zell Miller.</s>BLITZER: We'll see how enthusiastic that speech is, that keynote speech. I expect it will be very enthusiastic tonight. Zell Miller, the Democratic senator from Georgia, speaking in support of this Republican president. Let's get back to the issue of firefighters. The president of the United States right now in Queens, New York, meeting with firefighters, sitting down with them, watching this convention. A very symbolic act, especially here in New York City, in the aftermath of 9/11. CNN's Aaron Brown is watching all of this together with all of us. Aaron, as all of our viewers know, you were so, so instrumental in our coverage of 9/11. You know this city. You know the firefighters. How important is this meeting between the president and these firefighters?</s>AARON BROWN, HOST, \"NEWSNIGHT WITH AARON BROWN\": Well, I'm -- I'm sure the meeting with the president and the firefighters is important to the firefighters. Anytime you meet any president, it's an important moment, and I'm sure they're excited. I would just take the option here of flipping the question, Mr. Schneider, a little bit. One of the lines that the party, the Republicans have had to walk is at what point remembering 9/11 becomes exploiting 9/11 for political reasons. Is there a danger that being seen at a firehouse in the context of a political convention, creates a kind of hokey exploitive feel to it?</s>BILL SCHNEIDER, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: I honestly don't think so. I think that this union endorsed Mr. Bush. So, you know, it's a local union. It's not a huge union. But it is symbolic, and I think it's appropriate for him to appear with them. It would be something quite different, however, if he were to try to use Ground Zero as a political backdrop.</s>BROWN: Why is it different? Because here's the argument I think critics will make. We all know why they will say -- we all know why he's with the firefighters. Three hundred...</s>SCHNEIDER: Yes.</s>BROWN: Three hundred or almost 350 of them died. It's a great way to -- you done have to go to Ground Zero to get the same effect of being at Ground Zero.</s>SCHNEIDER: Ground Zero is sacred territory for the families of the 9/11 victims, who have become a potent political force. And I think they would respond very negatively if this convention or this president came there and tried to use it as a political backdrop. The firefighters, of course, sacrificed, suffered, lost a great number of their own people. But the fact that they endorsed him means that his appearing there as part of a political campaign doesn't appear inappropriate.</s>BROWN: OK. Let me ask you -- let me just change because we were talking a bit about this last night. John Edwards, who remains relatively -- I wouldn't say unknown, but not as well known as the vice president, and the vice president, and people are asked who do they prefer? I asked you this last night, before we looked at the poll results. And you actually nailed it. How do you explain this, that Edwards polls so much better than Cheney?</s>SCHNEIDER: Well, there's a simple explanation, which is this. Cheney is not a happy warrior. John Edwards is. People don't warm up to Dick Cheney. He's not warm and fuzzy. He's a tough guy. And I -- I saw Cheney's ratings really take a dive when it was revealed a couple months ago that he swore, rather ferociously at Pat Leahy, a Democratic senator, on the floor of the Senate. That was a lapse of decorum. He never apologized for it. I think a lot of people were shocked by it. He's not an easy guy to like, unlike President Bush.</s>BROWN: Well, we'll see how he does tonight -- Wolf.</s>BLITZER: Aaron, thanks very much. Bill Schneider, thanks to you, as well. An important note to our viewers. Aaron will have a complete special edition of \"NEWSNIGHT.\" That comes up at 11 p.m. Eastern tonight. Aaron Brown and Bill Schneider, thank you very much. We're going to get back to both of you in a moment. But we're going to take a quick break. We're standing by; we're awaiting more speakers here at the Republican convention in Madison Square Garden. The major speakers later tonight Zell Miller, Lynne Cheney and the vice president, Dick Cheney. Much more of our coverage when we come back.</s>ANNOUNCER: At the 1888 Republican convention, Fredrick Douglass became the first African-American to receive a vote for president. Douglass had spoken about the thousands of black soldiers who fought in the Civil War but could not vote. The former slave, an abolitionist, received one vote.</s>BLITZER: Madison Square Garden, the Republican National Convention. Zell Miller will be making the keynote address tonight, a highly unusual event for a Democrat to be doing it at a Republican convention.</s>GREENFIELD: Unprecedented. And there are two things about it...</s>BLITZER: Unprecedented?</s>GREENFIELD: Yes, it is. Not that one party member would cross, but at this level. But there are two things you should know about Zell Miller, why this is important to voters. He was the most popular politician in Georgia, because he used the state Lottery money to create these scholarships. One of the few states that actually made a difference. If you have a B average, and you're a Georgia kid in high school, you go to college for a few years. Second, this is how popular he is. Zell Miller has on his wall a whole bunch of pictures of Mickey Mantle, the great New York Yankee centerfield with whom he bonded. Now for a Georgia senator to have as a hero a New York Yankee says something about how confident and strong Zell Miller is politically in Georgia.</s>BLITZER: Well, we'll be watching. He's -- It could be a very lively enthusiastic, rousing kind of speaker.</s>WOODRUFF: I don't know what that says about the Atlanta Braves, but we can talk about that another time.</s>BLITZER: That's another matter. Throughout these conventions, the Democratic convention at the FleetCenter in Boston, the Republican convention here at Madison Square Garden, we've given some mini cameras to some delegates to take us behind the scenes, get a little flavor of what they're doing when they're not necessarily sitting right here at Madison Square Garden. Here's today's edition of our \"Delegate Diary.\"</s>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hi. I'm Andreas Salvalas (ph). I'm a delegate from Puerto Rico.</s>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Hi. I'm Katarina Tabalaras (ph), and I'm a delegate from the great state of California.</s>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm Jack Kapper (ph). I'm a delegate from Jacksonville, Florida.</s>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'm Georgia Moss Backer (ph). I'm a delegate here in the great state of New York. What you see on the floor at Madison Square Garden was just part of it. The rest of the day, we're going to a number of other activities that have been arranged for us, both educational activities, with respect to being able to talk to other Republican activists... I think this is an opportunity for us to do our part. And also to have a chance to experience this great city. I've just come from a fabulous lunch with the first lady, Laura Bush.</s>LAURA BUSH, FIRST LADY: All issues facing our nation are women's issues.</s>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Laura Bush spoke to the sold-out room here of Republican women about the importance of women to the president and her. Some of the events we'll be going to symposiums and lectures.</s>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What is it about...</s>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: \"W Is for Women\" is something that actually started four years ago, that I started to get out the vote for the president.</s>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We do a lot of networking, which again is very important for local politics. We all come to the convention with our own agendas, and they're usually local agendas. We feel that if we can move towards being a state, Puerto Rico will have a much better business climate. The schedule can be hectic. I've attended two Hispanic functions. This is the third one today.</s>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We want Bush!</s>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We want Bush!</s>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We want Bush!</s>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We want Bush!</s>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We're about to hear George 41 former president, speak to a very large group of Hispanics.</s>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They asked me to lead the pledge of allegiance on Wednesday for the Florida delegation.</s>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I pledge allegiance to the flag...</s>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I pledge allegiance to the flag...</s>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I pledge allegiance to the flag...</s>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'd like to meet as many people as I can. I'm not going to chase them down the street. This is Katherine Harris, congresswoman from the state of Florida.</s>REP. KATHERINE HARRIS (R), FLORIDA: No, that's my hero.</s>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You're my hero.</s>HARRIS: No, you're the hero. You're the American hero.</s>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: My primary responsibility as a delegate here is to vote and to help renominate George Bush, the president of the United States.</s>BLITZER: That's our \"Delegate Diary\" for today. Tomorrow, we'll have another \"Delegate Diary.\" Katherine Harris, she may have to get down to Florida pretty quickly if Hurricane Frances, which is a very, very serious, Category Four right now, gets there. A lot of the Florida politicians will be heading down. You know, Jeff, a lot of us think, a lot of the pundits, a lot of the experts, so-called, this has been a pretty successful Republican convention. On Monday night, Giuliani spoke enthusiastically, McCain. Last night, Schwarzenegger, Mrs. Bush. They all did very strong, powerful speeches. You would think that the trend in that famous market that you've been looking at in Iowa would show a slight increase going up for the Republican ticket, wouldn't you?</s>GREENFIELD: Really funny. And I think -- I'm guessing here what happened. We showed you the Iowa electronic futures that this market that, in effect, puts value on which candidate's campaign is doing better. And we showed you the last 12 days have had a big movement toward Bush. Take a look at the graph and see what happened today. Well, look at that. In the space of about two days, it appears that Bush has collapsed and Kerry has now caught up with him. Now, before you get all hot and bothered, and say, \"Oh, there must be some secret reason,\" here's my guess. That the Kerry supporters who've seen this on our air and others have said, \"Well, you know, it only costs a buck to play. We're going to get in, show our support for Kerry so that it will look better for him than it is.\" Which means, Wolf and Judy, that it just may turn out to be less valuable a measurement than it's been in the past and people tried to gave it.</s>WOODRUFF: My theory is they saw Jeff Greenfield talking about it, the Kerry supporters did, and they said, \"We're calling up and we're putting our money on John Kerry.\"</s>WOODRUFF: Well, for you campaign managers out there, if the price is right, I can show you whatever number you'd like to see.</s>BLITZER: What will they do with all that money?</s>GREENFIELD: It's a tiny little amount of money. It's really a market so that people can feel part of it. The point of it, the theory of it is that if you ask people what's going to happen, not what they want to happen and you ask as wide a net as you can, it doesn't matter the motive. In the long run, and this is the cliche, markets advocate information and historically this...</s>WOODRUFF: You said it's been accurate over time.</s>GREENFIELD: It's been accurate because this may be the first year people have tried to play it, though, for its public relations value.</s>WOODRUFF: And it's all because of Jeff that it's changed.</s>BLITZER: All right, Jeff Greenfield. We'll watch it together with all of our viewers. Much more coverage coming up from the Republican National Convention in Madison Square Garden. We'll take a short little break.</s>ANNOUNCER: On the last night of the 1988 Republican Convention in New Orleans, George Bush accepted the nomination with words that would haunt him throughout his presidency.</s>GEORGE H.W. BUSH, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Read my lips: no new taxes.</s>ANNOUNCER: It was a promise he couldn't keep.</s>BLITZER: Politics has changed so dramatically in recent years with the advent of the Internet and the opportunity for people to just simply go to various sites and get so much information instantaneously. There's no place, by the way, better to get that information than CNN.com. If you go to the main page and you take a look at the various options there, the history, the speakers, all of the activity going on in the world of politics right now, a wealth of information. You can literally spend hours, days going through that information. CNN.com, that's the place for politics right now. CNN's Carlos Watson knows a great deal about this. He spends hours and hours on the Internet. You're also looking at some of the blogs, as well, Carlos.</s>CARLOS WATSON, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: I am. There are 60,000 serious political blogs. Interestingly enough, Wolf, 60 percent of them weigh in conservative, whereas only about 40 percent lean liberal. You would think otherwise, given Howard Dean's success with the Internet. Today, you're seeing a lot of conversation on the blogs about what happened yesterday, about the twins' -- about the twins' speeches, Arnold's speech. But tonight, expect to see something called fisking. That's am unusual term, but it's a term that bloggers know. And it means that when someone gives a speech, they go point by point and deconstruct that speech, often offering counter points that you read in your newspaper the very next night or the very next day. So when Zell Miller speaks tonight, expect to see a number of these blogs fisk his speech and say, \"Here's where he contradicted himself in 1992. Here's where he contradicted himself in 1996.\" Conversely, you'll see some fisking on conservative sites of John Kerry's speech earlier today to the veterans and again when he speaks later this week. So the blogs are offering not only new stories, but also they're undercutting current stories and current perspectives from Kerry, Bush and others.</s>BLITZER: Jeff, some of these blogs are pretty reliable, but some of them are total junk.</s>GREENFIELD: And that's one of the glories of it. In the blogosphere, as Carlos well knows, they claim -- and it's a self- correcting process. Somebody can write something stupid and another blog will correct it. And in fact, Carlos, you may have seen this. There was a lot of blogging about the central theme of the Republicans, about George Bush's determination. And there were bloggers who came in and said, \"Wait a minute. What's so good about sticking with a policy that turns out to be wrong? Don't you want somebody to change his mind?\" So I think that's a perfect example of this fisking that went on. And hope you'll help us see what's going on tonight with Dick Cheney.</s>WATSON: You know, one other interesting thing that's happening with blogs is they're not only playing a role in presidential campaigns, but even in congressional campaigns. This past week, another story that not many people covered was a congressman in Virginia, a Republican congressman, who declined to run for reelection after one of the blogs claimed that he called a gay porn line. And that's where the story broke. And that's ultimately, a week and a half later, where he resigned. And this is not the first time that the blogs have driven a resignation. Remember, Trent Lott stepped down as Senate majority leader in many ways because these blogs, not the mainstream press, ourselves included, kept the story alive.</s>WOODRUFF: Carlos, for people out there who don't follow the web logs that closely, how much relation do they really have to how people vote? I mean, you know, is there a direct correlation between the activity on these web logs or blogs and -- and what happens at the polling places?</s>WATSON: Not yet. Not in the sense that the people who are reading them are truly undecided voters at the moment. They're more likely to be political junkies, people like me, people like you, who are involved. But it's growing rapidly. You probably have five to six million people a day in the U.S. who are tuning in to these. In some cases, some of these blogs have bigger daily readers than some midsized newspapers, like \"The Orlando Sentinel,\" as an example.</s>BLITZER: All right, Carlos. We'll be getting back to you on that and other issues, as well. Let's go back to CNN's senior political correspondent, Candy Crowley. She's down in the Florida delegation, where there's serious concern about Hurricane Frances -- Candy.</s>CANDY CROWLEY, CNN CORRESPONDENT: There is, Wolf. Standing beside me, Mel Martinez. Congratulations, you just won the Republican nomination for the Senate seat down there being vacated. I want to ask you, first, about what you hear about the hurricane and what you can tell us about preparations.</s>MEL MARTINEZ (R), FLORIDA SENATE CANDIDATE: Candy, I just flew in from Florida a couple of hours ago. And unfortunately, it looks like we're on the eye of the hurricane again. South Florida evacuation orders have already been issued. And reports I'm getting from family and friends is that already shelves in stores are emptying, and people are beginning to make serious preparations. It's unfortunate. We didn't need another storm right now.</s>CROWLEY: No, you didn't. You're, in fact, just recovering. We have talked a lot about the politics of storms and not so much the storms, but the response to them. Now that you're reeling here in Florida from Charley and now this other one is coming, how confident are you that the -- what you need is going to be there?</s>MARTINEZ: I think that Charley proved that the response that Florida provided was very adequate. I think -- you know, I was in some of the damaged areas last Sunday. And I think it's obvious that things have improved tremendously from Andrew. The question now is we're going to be tested to the max. You know, people have been stretched thin already. And now this is really going to compound the problem. Governor Bush, you know, stayed home in order to deal with the emergency. I saw him on the TV as I was leaving Orlando today. And he is, of course, facing the issue. I spoke with him last night. He's very concerned. But I think we have, in Florida, a very good emergency response situation that ought to be up to the task.</s>CROWLEY: You know a couple of people in Washington. Has anybody been put on alert in Washington? Are they already helping?</s>MARTINEZ: FEMA is very involved in Florida already. So I believe that they'll be deploying even more resources. I think FEMA's response and Florida's response was very good. And I think what we need to do now is redouble our efforts. This is a very big storm, a very bad storm. And it looks like no matter which way it moves, it's going to hit some of Florida.</s>CROWLEY: Now, as far as your delegation is concerned, some of them obviously have homes in the target area. Are any of them going home? Or what's happening?</s>MARTINEZ: I ran into some people at the hotel who were going home. They had family, elderly parents that they had to go see about, because they were in evacuation areas. So unquestionably, it's going to have an impact.</s>CROWLEY: Mel Martinez, new Republican candidate for the Senate seat there, appreciate it. We'll see you down there when the sun comes out. All right, thanks. Back to you, Wolf.</s>BLITZER: Candy Crowley in the Florida delegation, where there is serious concern. Indeed, serious concern around the country about Hurricane Frances making its way towards Florida. Already, evacuation orders along the coast. Palm Beach County, some 300,000 people told starting tomorrow a good time to start thinking about evacuating that area. Unclear where this hurricane is going to make landfall, where it's going to hit. But there's a wide area of deep concern for Friday, Saturday, Sunday, especially over the weekend. Hurricane Frances, following Hurricane Charley, Florida. Coming deeply -- getting deeply involved in hurricanes, unfortunately. We'll take a quick break. A special edition, by the way, of \"LARRY KING LIVE\" coming up from here at Madison Square Garden. Larry standing by with a full -- a full panel of guests, special guests, big Republicans. He has them all. They're all here with Larry King. We'll have a special edition at midnight, as well. We'll take a quick break. We'll be right back from Madison Square Garden.</s>BLITZER: Judy Woodruff, Jeff Greenfield and I are going to be back in one hour, 10 p.m. Eastern. It's that hour that the vice president of the United States will be speaking. In the meantime let's throw it over to Larry King. He's got a special -- you've got some good guests tonight, Larry.

    "document": "Section 501 of the Internal Revenue Code provides for tax-exempt status of certain corporations, trusts, and other organizations. This status allows qualifying organizations to claim exemption from federal income taxes. Subsection (c) of section 501 recognizes 28 categories of tax- exempt organizations, ranging from cemetery companies to multiemployer pension plan trusts. Section 501(c)(3), the section that recognizes charitable organizations, applied to approximately 1.3 million organizations in fiscal year 2017. These groups represent the largest number of 501(c) organizations. Federal tax law permits individual taxpayers and organizations to reduce their tax liability by deducting contributions to charitable organizations on their income tax returns. Individual taxpayers may deduct the amount of a contribution to charitable organizations from their gross income if they itemize their deductions. Charitable organizations provide many types of assistance, such as services for the aging or food and shelter for those in need. Taxpayers may support these activities by making contributions in the form of financial donations or in-kind gifts to qualified organizations. Federal law allows taxpayers to deduct charitable contributions from their adjusted gross income (AGI). This policy has been in place since 1917. An individual taxpayer may deduct up to 60 percent of his or her AGI for cash contributions, with 20 percent to 30 percent limits applying in some cases. A corporation may claim a limited deduction for charitable contributions made in cash or other property up to 10 percent of its taxable income for the year. An entity seeking tax-exempt status under 501(c)(3) from IRS must submit either a completed Form 1023, Application for Recognition of Exemption Under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, along with organizing documents, or a completed Form 1023-EZ. Both Form 1023 and Form 1023-EZ require the entity seeking recognition of its tax- exempt status to provide information regarding its charitable purpose, as well as certain financial data. IRS employees then review the forms to determine the entity\u2019s eligibility for tax-exemption status. Most tax-exempt charitable entities are required to file an annual information return from the Form 990 series. Certain small entities with gross receipts that are normally $50,000 or less may file Form 990-N Electronic Notice providing abbreviated information. Although the entity is filing its information return as a tax-exempt organization, the entity must pay employment taxes and taxes on unrelated business income, if applicable. IRS provides programs and products to help the entity understand specific issues related to its tax responsibilities. IRS personnel can audit an organization\u2019s or individual\u2019s submitted tax returns and financial information to verify that the reported tax is correct. IRS personnel audited 933,785 individual income tax returns in fiscal year 2017, according to IRS data. This was 0.6 percent of individual returns filed in calendar year 2016. From fiscal year 2006 to fiscal year 2017, the largest number of individual returns IRS audited was 1,564,690 in fiscal year 2010. There was a decrease in audits of individual tax returns after fiscal year 2011, which occurred about the same time that IRS\u2019s budget declined by about $2.1 billion (15.7 percent) from fiscal years 2011 through 2018, after adjusting for inflation. Concurrent with IRS\u2019s declining resources were increasing responsibilities, such as implementing aspects of the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. We reported in 2014 that budget cuts had resulted in a significant staffing decline and uneven performance at IRS. In March 2019, we reported that IRS was in the early stages of defining and addressing its workforce needs, but IRS officials stated that there was room for improvement in implementing its workforce plans, and that it was working on a corrective action plan that would address deficiencies noted in our report. The operating divisions that, along with conducting audits, carry out service and enforcement, and that deal most often with abusive tax schemes or tax-exempt entities are TE/GE, SB/SE, and LB&I. These divisions interact with taxpayers and entities that file tax returns. In particular, each of the three divisions may audit taxpayers or entities to determine whether information filed was reported accurately. IRS has set one of its cross-divisional objectives as identifying \u201cnew types of tax transactions or promotions that are either abusive or potentially abusive requiring different levels of coordination and varying strategies.\u201d Another of TE/GE\u2019s audit objectives is to \u201cpromote the highest degree of voluntary compliance with the statutes governing qualification of plans and exemption of certain types of organizations from tax and to determine the extent of compliance and the causes of noncompliance with the tax laws by plans and organizations.\u201d TE/GE accomplishes this objective by auditing charitable organizations\u2019 compliance with the tax code through its Exempt Organizations unit. In addition to this function, Exempt Organizations also reviews organizations\u2019 tax-exempt status applications and makes tax-exempt status determinations. It also coordinates with other state and federal agencies. Additionally, it audits entities to identify and address noncompliance, where it may propose tax assessments or changes to the tax-exempt status of the audited entity. TE/GE uses various enforcement processes, such as referrals from the public and other parts of IRS and data-driven approaches, to select tax- exempt organization for possible audits. IRS projects that Exempt Organizations will receive approximately 1.6 million filings from tax- exempt and government entities in fiscal year 2019, primarily Form 990 series information returns. SB/SE mainly oversees small businesses and self-employed taxpayers and all other businesses with assets of less than $10 million. Examples of the types of businesses that SB/SE covers include small-business start-ups, small businesses with or without employees, taxpayers with rental properties, taxpayers with farming businesses, and individuals investing in businesses such as partnerships. Overall, IRS projects that SB/SE will receive approximately 59.4 million tax returns in fiscal year 2019. The Lead Development Center, an office within SB/SE, receives referrals from and facilitates communication between SB/SE and TE/GE on the subject of abusive tax schemes. LB&I oversees tax compliance of large partnerships, S Corporations, and C corporations with assets of $10 million or more, as well as individuals with high wealth (those with tens of millions of dollars in assets or earnings) or international tax issues. IRS projects that LB&I will receive approximately 400,000 corporate tax-return filings in fiscal year 2019. LB&I has developed a compliance strategy to identify potential issues that arise during audits of tax returns. LB&I also oversees the processing of reportable transaction disclosure filings by those involved in reportable transactions. A transaction includes all the factual elements relevant to the expected tax treatment of any investment, entity, plan, or arrangement. It also includes any series of steps carried out as part of a plan. Transactions become \u201creportable\u201d (meaning a taxpayer must report it to IRS) when they fall under one or more of the following categories: listed transactions, confidential transactions, contractual protection transactions, loss transactions, and transactions of interest. A listed transaction is any transaction that IRS has identified as an abusive tax avoidance transaction and has identified in published guidance as a listed transaction. Taxpayers that have engaged in transactions that have tax consequences or tax strategies described in published IRS guidance are required by law to disclose the transaction to IRS. The fact that a transaction must be reported does not mean IRS will disallow the tax benefit, but IRS uses the reports to assess compliance. Appendix IV discusses reportable transaction types in greater detail. Taxpayers are required to disclose all types of reportable transactions on Form 8886, Reportable Transaction Disclosure Statement. Similarly, advisers helping taxpayers conduct reportable transactions are required to file Form 8918, Material Advisor Disclosure Statement. Tax-exempt entities are required to file Form 8886-T, Disclosure by Tax- Exempt Entity Regarding Prohibited Tax Shelter Transaction, when the entity is a party to a listed, confidential, or contractual protection transaction, and the entity knows the identify of any other party in the transaction. Tax-exempt entities that are party to a listed or confidential transaction may be subject to an excise tax of 100 percent of the income from the transaction. Transactions that require the filing of form 8886-T constitute a different, smaller range of activity than transactions requiring the filing of Form 8886. The Office of Tax Shelter Analysis, a unit within LB&I, supports LB&I\u2019s work by coordinating its tax shelter planning and operations. This office also analyzes information collected from disclosure forms. According to IRS policy, if the Office of Tax Shelter Analysis determines a formal investigation is warranted, it presents the information to the LB&I Technical Tax Shelter Promoter Committee, an office within LB&I that has sole authority to approve any proposed investigations. Taxpayers seeking to reduce their tax liability through charitable donations may participate in legal tax planning strategies that allow them to maximize their deductions while giving to charitable organizations. In contrast to these legal tax planning strategies involving charitable donations, abusive tax schemes occur when taxpayers conduct transactions that are not supported by established law to improperly claim tax benefits, or that have no economic significance or business purpose other than the avoidance of tax, among other factors. IRS has long recognized that some charitable donors and tax-exempt organizations have engaged in abusive tax schemes. One such scheme can consist of a donor grossly overvaluing a charitable contribution to obtain a larger deduction on his or her filed tax returns. Another abusive tax scheme can entail a tax-exempt organization providing benefits to a private shareholder or individual. As we previously have reported, the abusive transactions that comprise abusive tax schemes have been a long-standing, ever-changing, and often hidden problem for IRS. The following three examples illustrate various ways that an entity\u2019s tax- exempt status can be used in transactions that are not supported by law or are inconsistent with the law\u2019s intent, and how otherwise legitimate tax- exempt activity can be exploited improperly. A conservation easement is a legal agreement that grants an organization the right to restrict the development and use of property for conservation purposes with the intent of preserving the land or buildings. If statutory requirements are met, taxpayers may donate an easement to a qualified organization and receive a charitable income tax deduction for the appraised value of the easement. A conservation easement becomes \u201csyndicated\u201d if a person or company promoting the easement (a promoter) offers multiple investors in a partnership or pass-through entity the opportunity to claim charitable deductions based on the value of the easement in return for cash. The Brookings Institution estimated that investments in syndicated conservation easements totaled $623 million in 2016, an increase of 29 percent from $484 million in 2015. It further estimated that because tax deductions from syndicated conservation easement contributions generate a benefit greater than the value of the investments themselves, the tax deductions resulted in federal tax revenue loss between $1 billion and $1.9 billion in 2015 and between $1.3 billion and $2.4 billion in 2016. According to IRS, in a syndicated conservation easement, promoters purchase land and convey ownership to a pass-through entity, such as a partnership. The promoters offer interests in the pass-through entity to prospective investors who are then able to deduct their share of the value of the easement as a charitable contribution. In its guidance, IRS said the conservation easement becomes noncompliant if, for example, the promoters obtain an appraisal that purports to be a qualified appraisal, but that greatly inflates the value of the conservation easement based on unreasonable assumptions about the development potential of the real property. Because the promoters inflate the value of the property, the investors may benefit by claiming a charitable deduction on their tax returns that exceeds their initial investment. Figure 1 shows the steps in the formation of a syndicated conservation easement and the point at which the easement becomes noncompliant when promoters obtain an inflated value for the easement. IRS has indicated its concern about the potential for abuse of conservation easements, whether syndicated or otherwise, when used in ways not supported by the law. In December 2016, the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) and IRS issued Notice 2017-10 designating syndicated conservation easements as listed transactions. This notice provides that certain syndicated conservation easements promoted with a return on investment of at least 250 percent will be identified as listed transactions. It also provided details on how Treasury and IRS view these transactions as forms of abuse. Although promoters who abuse syndicated conservation easements exploit tax-exempt entities, the law does not treat the tax-exempt entity as a participant, meaning that even when a promoter is found to use a syndicated easement in a noncompliant manner, the tax-exempt entity associated with the scheme may still be considered compliant. In addition to the potential for overvaluation of easements, Treasury and IRS considered that syndicated conservation easements may become problematic because of the potential they have to involve transactions that violate the economic substance doctrine. Because of its concerns, IRS has identified taxpayer abuse of conservation easements as a risk area for noncompliance. Syndicated easements also illustrate how noncompliance can cross the areas of responsibility of IRS\u2019s audit divisions. In this case, the beneficiary of the scheme may be a small-business taxpayer (SB/SE\u2019s responsibility) or a corporation (LB&I\u2019s responsibility), even though the scheme hinges on an inflated appraisal and being able to donate to the tax-exempt recipient (TE/GE\u2019s responsibility). A donor-advised fund is a fund or account held by a charity that receives contributions from donors who may advise, but not control, how the organization uses the money. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 defined donor-advised funds in the Internal Revenue Code and subjected the funds to new requirements. Because donor-advised fund accounts are operated by charities, contributions to these funds are deductible at a higher percentage of adjusted gross income (generally 50 percent or 60 percent for cash contributions) than donations to private foundations (generally 30 percent). Some donors may use the donor-advised funds in ways that IRS considers improper. For example, prior to tax-law changes in 2006, IRS said that abusive donor-advised funds are those that appear to be established to generate questionable charitable deductions, and provide impermissible economic benefits to donors and their families (including tax-sheltered investment income for the donors). Figure 2 illustrates how donor-advised fund accounts operate and highlights where in the process the parties involved could abuse the funds or raise policy concerns about how donor advised funds have been used. Donor-advised funds have grown in various measures in recent years, according to data compiled by the National Philanthropic Trust. For example, it reports that from 2013 to 2017, the total grants made by donor-advised funds grew from $9.83 billion to $19.08 billion, and contributions grew from $17.24 billion to $29.23 billion. Total assets held in donor-advised funds increased from $57.1 billion to $110.01 billion as well, according to the organization\u2019s study. In 2017, about 463,000 donor- advised funds existed in the United States, with an estimated $110 billion in assets, according to the National Philanthropic Trust. Some of the largest of these funds in terms of assets are sponsored by financial institutions, religious groups, and community foundations, while others are independent, according to our review of selected donor-advised funds\u2019 sponsoring organizations\u2019 websites and data from the National Philanthropic Trust. Patient assistance programs help patients afflicted with certain medical ailments obtain financial assistance for medical care or free drug products and these programs may qualify for tax-exempt status. Pharmaceutical companies may establish their own patient assistance programs or make monetary donations to independent charities\u2019 patient assistance programs. In addition to financial support, pharmaceutical companies may donate medication (through in-kind product donations) to patient assistance programs. Donations such as these allow pharmaceutical companies to claim a limited tax deduction for charitable contributions. If they claim deductions, the deductions may be up to 10 percent of the corporations\u2019 taxable income when donating to charities. The possibility of donors receiving private benefits in excess of the charitable deduction creates potential risks to participating pharmaceutical companies and compliance challenges for IRS, according federal regulators. For example, because independent charity patient assistance programs may be 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organizations, pharmaceutical manufacturers\u2019 profits generated from sales of their products to individuals receiving help from patient assistance programs that they donate to may raise issues of inurement. Figure 3 summarizes how a hypothetical patient assistance program works and highlights points in the process where potential abuse of the program may occur. The federal government has investigated cases of potential private benefit by pharmaceutical companies and patient assistance programs. For example, IRS filed a court summons in May 2017 in an ongoing investigation of a patient assistance program over concerns that it spent the majority of its donations on copayment support that went to patients who were prescribed medication from companies that had donated money to the patient assistance program. As shown in the tax scheme examples previously discussed, abusive schemes with tax-exempt entities can involve the tax-exempt entity directly or leverage an entity\u2019s tax-exempt status indirectly to reduce taxes. Consequently, the characteristics of audits involving abusive tax schemes, such as which IRS operating division is responsible for the audit, will differ according to the type of scheme. In addition, IRS generally presents information about abusive tax schemes under a category it calls abusive tax avoidance transactions. The abusive tax schemes we have been discussing in this report are a subset of abusive tax avoidance transactions in which the transaction or arrangement involves multiple types of entities. IRS data do not allow us to identify separately the transactions involving multiple entities. The discussion that follows describes trends under the assumption that over time abusive transactions involving multiple entities would closely track total abusive transactions. TE/GE audited 2,294 tax-exempt entities with what IRS identified as abusive tax avoidance transactions in the 10-year period from fiscal year 2008 through 2017. As shown in figure 4, the number of abusive- transaction audits fell from a high of 886 in fiscal year 2009 to 10 or less in fiscal year 2017. This decline represented at least a 98.9 percent decrease in audits performed by TE/GE (see appendix V, table 6). The decline in abusive-transaction audits generally corresponds with the overall decrease in audit activity by IRS over recent years (see appendix V, tables 2, 3, and 4). During the same 10-year period, TE/GE assessed a total tax increase of $107 million based on its audits of tax-exempt entities and the average tax increase per audit was $46,804. The amount assessed for the tax increase declined from 45.3 million in 2008 to 1.2 million in the merged years of 2016 and 2017. The effectiveness and efficiency of the audit process may be reflected in the no-change rate and staff days associated with the audits. The no- change rate\u2014the percentage of audits that results in no tax change\u2014was 13.9-percent (see appendix V, table 11). IRS uses this ratio as an indicator of how effectively IRS identifies noncompliant taxpayers (a lower no-change rate on its audits is consistent with more effective audit selection methods). The lower rate may also reflect higher economic efficiency because less IRS and taxpayer time and other resources are used for auditing compliant returns. On average, TE/GE spent 70 hours per audit of tax-exempt entities from fiscal year 2008 through 2017 (see appendix V, table 9). Audits involving abusive schemes where taxpayers leverage an entity\u2019s tax exempt status\u2014but the tax-exempt entities are not the subject of the audit\u2014are the responsibility of SB/SE and LB&I. To determine the minimum number of audits these divisions conducted on abusive schemes involving tax-exempt entities, we used IRS project codes that IRS agreed were relevant. For these project codes, SB/SE and LB&I conducted 4,207 audits over the 10-year period. The numbers of audits generally decreased over the period except for increases in 2012, 2015, and 2017 for LB&I audits and increases in fiscal year 2015 and 2017 for SB/SE audits. Combined SB/SE and LB&I audits fell from 1,176 in fiscal year 2008 to 99 in fiscal year 2017, a 91.6 percent decrease (see appendix V, table 13). SB/SE and LB&I recommended about $8.3 billion in tax changes over the 10-year period. As shown in figure 5, the average recommended amount was larger for LB&I, but tended to fluctuate more than the SB/SE amounts. The average tax change amount per audit over the 10-year period recommended by SB/SE was $89,399. The average amount recommended by LB&I was $8.6 million. Figure 5 also shows how both divisions had a surge in recommended tax amount changes for 2017 compared to prior years. SB/SE\u2019s recommended changes increased from $270,131 in fiscal year 2016 to $127 million in fiscal year 2017. LB&I recommended changes increased from $299 million in 2016 to $555 million in 2017. IRS officials could not provide an explanation for the surge in 2017 (see appendix V, table 14). Again, the divisions\u2019 resource use may be reflected in staff days and the no-change rate. SB/SE and LB&I combined spent 218 hours, on average, per audit for the audits involving tax-exempt entities identified by project codes (see appendix V, table 15). The no-change rate for SB/SE audits we examined involving tax-exempt entities identified by project code was 10.9 percent. LB&I audits involving tax-exempt entities had a no-change rate of 15.5 percent (see appendix V, table 16). Numbers of audits of all types of abusive transactions showed a pattern of decline similar to audits involving tax exempt entities. SB/SE and LB&I conducted a total of 155,467 audits involving all types of abusive transactions from fiscal year 2008 to fiscal year 2017. As shown in figure 6, the total number of these audits conducted by each of the operating divisions fell in most years. Abusive transaction audits conducted by SB/SE and LB&I fell from 26,519 in fiscal year 2008 to a low of 4,248 in fiscal year 2017, an 84 percent decrease in audits closed during this period (see appendix V, table 5). Audits involving tax-exempt entities resulted in higher average tax changes than audits for the total of all abusive transactions. Combined, SB/SE and LB&I recommended a total of $39 billion in tax changes for the total of all for abusive-transaction audits. As shown in figure 7, SB/SE recommended tax amount changes that averaged $40,834 per audit and LB&I recommended tax amount changes that averaged $3 million per audit. The recommended tax change per abusive-transaction audit was larger for audits involving tax-exempt entities than for the total of all abusive-transaction audits in both operating divisions which were (as described above) $89,399 for SB/SE and $8.6 million for LB&I. The total recommended tax amount change for SB/SE decreased from $1.4 billion to $339 million, a 75 percent decrease over the period. For LB&I, the recommended tax amount change decreased from $7.5 billion to $866 million, an 89 percent decrease (see appendix V, table 7). We estimated audits involving tax-exempt entities identified on the basis of project codes led to SB/SE and LB&I recommending about $8.3 billion in tax changes over the 10-year period. The no-change rate for all SB/SE abusive transaction audits over the period was 8.8 percent. The no-change rate for all LB&I abusive- transaction audits was 14 percent (see appendix V, table 10). Combined, SB/SE and LB&I spent a total of 6.6 million staff hours for the total of all abusive transaction audits from fiscal year 2008 to 2017, spending, on average, 42 hours per audit for all abusive-transaction audits (see appendix V, table 8). As described above, SB/SE and LB&I spent more in resources, 218 hours, on average, per audit of tax-exempt schemes, than the average for the total of all abusive-transaction audits. The majority (88 percent) of taxpayer audits involving tax-exempt entities identified on the basis of project codes for both SB/SE and LB&I had an Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) of more than $50,000, with about 40 percent of the audits involving the taxpayers with AGI falling between $100,000 and $500,000. The SB/SE audits had an average AGI of $1.2 million and median AGI value between $200,000 and $500,000. LB&I audits had an average AGI of $6.2 million and a median AGI value between $1.0 million and $1.5 million. The majority of business taxpayers with abusive-transaction audits involving tax-exempts (about 70 percent) reported zero gross receipts (see appendix V, tables 17 and 18). While the audit data examined above show the noncompliance IRS has found regarding abusive schemes with tax-exempt entities, information about the taxpayers involved in the transactions can also be derived from the IRS disclosure forms. Most of the taxpayers identified partnerships as the entities involved in the listed transactions that they reported. Of the taxpayer disclosures identifying a tax-exempt entity on Form 8886, 97.8 percent identified the type of reportable transaction as a listed transaction and 95.5 percent listed a partnership for type of entity involved in the transaction. Further, 98.1 percent of taxpayers claimed a deduction from their AGI as the benefit generated by the transaction and 5 percent claimed an ordinary loss as the tax benefit. The different disclosure reports that IRS receives from tax-exempt entities, taxpayers, and tax advisors contain data that identify the potential involvement of tax-exempt entities with reportable transactions. However, there are differences in the legal filing requirements, the types of information supplied, and the number of disclosure forms filed. Few tax-exempt entities directly disclose their involvement in prohibited transactions to IRS. Regulations require that certain tax-exempt entities disclose information on a prohibited tax shelter transaction to which the entity is a party. For calendar years 2004 through 2016, IRS received 71 Form 8886-T disclosures from tax-exempt entities that were a party to a prohibited transaction. Moreover, the actual number of filers making disclosures was smaller, only 33, because some submitted multiple forms during the period. Many more tax-exempt entities were identified by taxpayers filing the Form 8886, which requires a different, broader range of transactions to be reported than the Form 8886-T. For calendar years 2000 through 2017, IRS received more than 979,900 Form 8886 disclosure reports from taxpayers. Of that number the taxpayer identified a tax-exempt entity as part of the reportable transaction on 32,847 disclosures or 3.4 percent of all Form 8886 reports. A smaller number was identified by tax advisors on Form 8918. For calendar years 2007 through 2018, out of the 16,477 Form 8918 disclosure statements received from tax advisors, 155 submissions identified a tax-exempt entity as part of a reportable transaction. While detail about the transactions themselves\u2014when they appear in the form narratives\u2014is not readily available from the Form 8886 disclosure databases. IRS\u2019s Research, Applied Analytics and Statistics Division has created an analytic tool for analyzing narrative information that it has tested on the Form 8886. When we performed a test analysis using this tool on the narrative fields on the Form 8886, we identified keywords that may help isolate tax-exempt organization involvement in potentially abusive schemes and ultimately help select returns for more detailed review. This more detailed review is required because transactions reported on the Form 8886 are not necessarily noncompliant. For our test analysis, we selected certain terms related to known abusive tax schemes involving tax-exempt entities such as \u201cconservation easement\u201d or related to the tax-exempt sector such as \u201ccharitable organization\u201d and counted the number of times the terms appeared in the narrative field of 26,632 Form 8886 disclosures made in fiscal year 2017. For example, the term \u201cconservation easement\u201d occurred in the narrative field of 6,767 disclosure forms and the term charitable organization occurred on 17 disclosure forms. Through further searching on terms that might relate to charitable organizations, such as \u201ccharity,\u201d \u201csports,\u201d \u201cchildren,\u201d \u201canimals,\u201d \u201cfoundation,\u201d and \u201cscientific,\u201d we identified 211 occurrences. IRS is not undertaking this type of analysis of taxpayer disclosures, which would expand its ability to identify tax-exempt entities and evaluate their potential involvement with reportable transactions, as discussed later in this report. IRS operates various programs to identify abusive tax schemes involving tax-exempt entities. Not all of these programs exclusively address abusive tax schemes with tax-exempt entities but nevertheless can provide relevant information on that issue. For example, the Office of Tax Shelter Analysis processes disclosures of reportable transactions, including those related to tax-exempt entities, and the Lead Development Center may collect information about abusive schemes related to tax- exempt entities as part of its role in dealing with abusive tax transactions in general. As figure 8 illustrates, several of these programs in practice are linked by the Service-wide Compliance Strategy Executive Steering Committee. This committee is responsible for collecting input from the operating divisions (TE/GE, SB/SE, and LB&I), as well as other parts of IRS, about abusive tax schemes that cross divisional responsibilities, including schemes involving tax-exempt entities. The Executive Steering Committee also may make decisions about how to address abusive tax schemes that cross the operating divisions\u2019 responsibility. IRS officials said that the operating divisions are individually responsible for monitoring the committee\u2019s performance. Therefore, the committee\u2019s decisions depend on what information the operating divisions provide. As figure 8 also shows, the operating divisions pass information about abusive schemes among themselves through referrals, making clear communication among the operating divisions critical for IRS in identifying abusive tax schemes. An IRS office that more directly addresses potential abusive schemes with tax-exempt organizations is TE/GE\u2019s Compliance Planning and Classification office (CP&C). This office has several responsibilities relating to identifying abusive tax schemes and communicating with other parts of IRS, as well as coordinating with other operating divisions on potential noncompliance. For example, CP&C is responsible for reviewing emerging abusive tax schemes, conducting research, and reviewing suggestions from a computer portal through which staff can raise potential issues about compliance. The portal also serves as the foundation to TE/GE\u2019s compliance issue identification process. We found that IRS maintains a variety of programs to identify tax schemes involving tax exempt entities agency-wide, and these programs together fully met seven of our 10 criteria. Appendix I contains more information about the criteria we used in our analysis and a table that summarizes the results of our analysis. One criterion that IRS fully met was identifying areas of authority. All of the programs we reviewed had documentation showing the responsibilities the program was to fulfill and the roles it was to perform. IRS\u2019s programs also fully met the criterion for ensuring competency by having documented procedures for training to enhance staff\u2019s responsibilities across the programs we reviewed and met the communication criterion by, for example, having coordination meetings among officials representing the different operating divisions. In addition, IRS met the criterion for conducting monitoring activities by, for example, having inventory reports on TE/GE\u2019s issue submission portal and maintaining a monitoring group over TE/GE\u2019s audit plans. Finally, IRS met all three of our fraud-related criteria with programs or procedures that specifically identify fraud, such as TE/GE\u2019s Fraud Investigation Unit, or that assist auditors in identifying fraud on returns, such as IRS\u2019s Fraud Handbook. Reviewing whether auditors assessed fraud risk is also part of TE/GE\u2019s quality review system. In the following sections, we discuss how IRS did not meet the other three internal control criteria. A relatively low number of tax exempt entities filing Forms 8886-T combined with our analysis of audit data raises questions about whether tax-exempt entities are filing these forms as often as they should. As we discussed above, tax-exempt entities filed only 71 Forms 8886-T over a 12-year period from fiscal year 2004 through 2016, where they listed prohibited transactions. At about the same time, taxpayers in general filed thousands of Forms 8886 annually where they identified tax-exempt entities as part of their reportable transactions. In addition, when we compared Form 8886 filings that identified tax- exempt entities as part of the reportable transaction with SB/SE and LB&I audit data, again for the same time period, we found 432 closed cases with tax changes. Although we did not determine whether the subject of these audits was the abusive scheme involving a tax-exempt entity, the result of 432 closed audit cases suggests that tax-exempt entities may be part of more prohibited transactions than those reported on the 71 Form 8886-T filed during the period. The audit cases identified in SB/SE and LB&I data resulted in about $1.9 billion in tax changes. The average per audit tax change recommended by SB/SE was $65,143 and by LB&I was $19 million. A similar analysis could be conducted comparing audit results with data from Form 8918, which is filed by tax advisors. IRS officials said the disparity between the number of Form 8886 filings and the small number of 8886-T filings has not raised concerns because the legal requirements for tax-exempt entities filing Form 8886-T are narrower than the requirements taxpayers must follow to file Form 8886, as we discussed earlier. However, IRS has not undertaken a risk assessment to test whether this explanation\u2014that the lower number of filings should be expected because the filing requirement is narrower\u2014is valid, which is inconsistent with the internal control standards for risk assessment. The Office of Tax Shelter Analysis sends Form 8886-T filings it receives to TE/GE, and the Compliance Planning and Classification office reviews these filings, but no documented process exists to determine whether all tax-exempt entities that should file Form 8886-T were filing the form as required. In addition, IRS provided us with no studies investigating the causes and consequences of such a small number of filings. While IRS has adopted processes to help ensure proper filing for other disclosures, such as Form 8886, it has not extended these to Form 8886- T. In 2011, we recommended that IRS establish a process to periodically check whether Form 8886 filers met their reporting obligations. In response to that recommendation, IRS implemented a new indicator and matching process to review whether filers met their obligations. IRS officials told us that similar controls do not exist for 8886-T filings. TE/GE officials said one way that they ensure forms are filed is through penalties, yet they said they have never assessed the penalty for nonfiling of Form 8886-T. TE/GE officials also said that another way they ensure proper filing is through education and cited such documentation as IRS Publication 557, Tax-Exempt Status for Your Organization. IRS said it provides other information through its website informing charities of their responsibilities. Despite this education effort, it may still be the case that a lack of knowledge about filing requirements reduces the number of tax-exempt entities that file. An IRS official suggested that charities may not have the financial sophistication to realize that they are involved in a prohibited tax shelter transaction and therefore are required to file a Form 8886-T. Without a better understanding of the reasons behind the low filing, IRS cannot be reasonably certain that tax-exempt entities are following the law on filing Form 8886-T and ensuring tax-exempt entities\u2019 compliance. We were able to use the IRS audit and disclosure data to perform certain analyses on abusive tax schemes with tax-exempt entities for this report, but data deficiencies prevented us from undertaking more complete analysis and hinder management\u2019s use of the data. These deficiencies\u2014 which are inconsistent with internal control standards for quality information\u2014weaken divisions\u2019 ability to identify abusive tax schemes involving tax-exempt entities as well as the Executive Steering Committee\u2019s ability to make decisions about how to address abusive tax schemes across divisions and develop compliance strategies. First, the descriptions of project codes in audit data do not always clearly identify abusive tax schemes across operating divisions. For example, one code LB&I uses to identify abusive transactions in audit data is \u201cdomestic tax shelters.\u201d TE/GE uses two codes both titled, \u201cAbusive Tax Avoidance Transactions,\u201d and SB/SE uses a code titled, \u201cTax Shelter List Projects.\u201d IRS officials provided no additional documentation on what these codes mean. The lack of specificity hinders analyses of abusive tax schemes involving tax-exempt entities. IRS officials said that they do not keep an overall list of project codes that cover abusive schemes involving tax-exempt entities. This limits their ability to readily assess and manage audits of abusive tax schemes involving tax-exempt entities. However, they did say such a list, which would be effective in certain circumstances or operating divisions, might be possible to produce. Cross-operating division analysis could enhance the Executive Steering Committee\u2019s objective to assess emerging issues and develop policy responses. Second, we found that there were no project codes consistently identifying abusive schemes involving tax-exempt entities that crossed operating divisions. Instead, IRS officials said each operating division assigned its own project codes that identify abusive tax schemes. Having no uniform way to identify abusive schemes across the operating divisions makes analysis of schemes that overlap with different operating divisions\u2019 responsibilities problematic and inhibits IRS from accomplishing its objectives. The lack of cross-divisional project codes echoes findings from our 2011 report on abusive tax avoidance transaction data, where we found that some abusive tax avoidance transaction data were reported inconsistently across IRS divisions. We said in that report that without comprehensive or consistent information, IRS does not have the best information to decide how to evaluate the results of its audits. Our recommendation to separately track the tax amounts recommended, assessed, and collected between abusive tax avoidance transaction issues and nonabusive transaction issues remains open because IRS said resource and capability constraints preclude it from capturing information in this way. Similarly, IRS officials told us it would be costly and logistically prohibitive to create new project codes identifying abusive schemes involving tax- exempt entities that crossed divisions. However, as we said in our previous report, tracking audit results for abusive and nonabusive transactions would provide IRS management with the data needed to make more informed decisions about program effectiveness and resource allocation. If, as IRS indicated above, it would be possible to make an overall list of codes, such a list could be used to achieve the same results as adjusting the database system. Although IRS does not identify some data that would facilitate analysis of abusive tax schemes involving tax-exempt entities spanning the operating divisions, we found evidence that TE/GE\u2019s Returns Inventory and Classification System (RICS) could at least partially support analysis and monitoring of audit data across the operating divisions. For example, the RICS user manual states that RICS can access a variety of forms outside of TE/GE\u2019s purview, such as Form 1065 and the Form 1120 series tax returns, which typically are handled by SB/SE or LB&I respectively. While TE/GE uses RICS, officials we spoke with at LB&I, for example, were not familiar with RICS\u2019 capabilities. TE/GE officials said IRS would have to study whether using RICS in other divisions would generate productive audits. As we discussed earlier in this report, IRS\u2019s Research, Analysis and Statistics office also has developed the capability to analyze narrative information, which it has tested on the Form 8886. However, this analytical tool is not being used operationally to review the Form 8886 or any other disclosure report. Our analysis shows that the tool has the potential to help IRS better search disclosure reports for additional information about transactions that could help IRS identify potentially abusive schemes involving tax-exempt entities. For example, it can be used to identify keywords in disclosure reports that could help determine whether a tax-exempt entity was a party to a reportable transaction that warrants further investigation for compliance. However, IRS officials told us they have no plans to use this tool but agreed that it may be beneficial. IRS officials also told us that TE/GE does not routinely review Form 8886 filings that show tax-exempt entities as being part of the reported transaction because the data are not clear indicators of noncompliance. However, by not using these data for possible leads, IRS may be missing opportunities to identify known abusive schemes, which is inconsistent with internal controls on using quality information. Again, our analysis of the 8886 filings combined with audit results suggests that there is potential for IRS to use the Form 8886 to identify potential noncompliance. Without conducting such an analysis, IRS may be missing opportunities to identify leads on tax-exempt entities in abusive tax schemes. We previously showed that abusive tax schemes involving tax-exempt entities can involve multiple types of entities that cross IRS\u2019s operating divisions\u2019 areas of responsibility. We also showed that IRS relies on auditors to refer potentially noncompliant entities involved in an abusive scheme to the responsible operating division. Consequently, IRS needs assurance that auditors\u2019 make referrals when appropriate. However, IRS lacks a control to ensure that auditors make referrals correctly. An IRS audit official said that managers are tasked with reviewing auditors\u2019 work and identifying referrals that should have been made during case closings. However, there is no documented guidance specifically directing managers to assess whether auditors correctly identified referrals involving abusive tax schemes, reducing assurance that such auditors will make such identifications correctly and route them appropriately. IRS\u2019s audit quality review systems, which generally measure how well auditors follow procedures from a random sample of audits, also do not assess whether referrals of abusive schemes involving tax-exempt entities are properly identified and routed. The lack of guidance to ensure auditors make referrals across the operating divisions increases risk that the responsible division will not be alerted to potential noncompliance to make further assessments for enforcement action. Absent specific guidance, there also is increased risk that even when one entity in an abusive tax scheme is audited, other entities in the scheme may go unexamined. This is inconsistent with internal controls standards for control activities. Abusive tax schemes involving tax-exempt entities pose enforcement challenges for IRS, as schemes can cross IRS\u2019s operating divisions\u2019 areas of responsibility and evolve over time. While IRS has established programs to help identify new abusive schemes, opportunities exit to better ensure that IRS accomplishes its objectives of identifying existing and emerging schemes. In particular, opportunities exist for IRS to improve the quality of its data and how it is using the data it has in managing its programs. Because IRS uses codes to identify abusive schemes that are not consistent across the operating divisions, its efforts to formulate policy across operating divisions may be made more difficult. Also, IRS may not be making the best use of its data by not using existing tools that may be helpful in analyzing data to identify abusive schemes involving tax-exempt entities. Next, IRS has an opportunity to reduce the risk that tax-exempt entities are noncompliant by assessing the number of Form 8886-T filings. Finally, referrals across divisions play an important role in IRS\u2019s ability to identify schemes with tax-exempt entities, but IRS\u2019s internal control activities over referrals are limited. By taking actions to further strengthen its internal controls, IRS could enhance its efforts to identify and combat abusive tax schemes that involve tax-exempt entities. We are making the following five recommendations to IRS: The Commissioner of Internal Revenue should undertake a risk assessment of tax-exempt entity Form 8886-T filings. Based on the findings of the risk assessment, IRS should then determine whether steps are needed to increase compliance, such as, for example, through increased outreach to tax-exempt entities or assessment of nonfiling penalties. (Recommendation 1) The Commissioner of Internal Revenue should link audit data on abusive tax schemes involving tax-exempt entities across operating divisions and use the linked data to assess emerging issues and develop policy responses. (Recommendation 2) The Commissioner of Internal Revenue should test the ability of the Return Inventory Classification System to facilitate analysis and monitoring of audit data across the operating divisions and to support the IRS\u2019s enforcement objectives. (Recommendation 3) The Commissioner of Internal Revenue should use existing data analytic tools to further mine Form 8886 and Form 8918 data, which could be used to find audit leads on tax-exempt entity involvement in potentially abusive tax schemes. (Recommendation 4) The Commissioner of Internal Revenue should develop guidance to help managers ensure referrals about abusive schemes involving tax-exempt entities are made across operating divisions. This could be accomplished by, for example, adopting specific guidance for audit managers to look for referral accuracy in their reviews of case closings. (Recommendation 5) We provided a draft of this report to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue for review and comment. On August 16, 2019, the IRS Deputy Commissioner for Services and Enforcement provided written comments stating that IRS agreed with GAO\u2019s recommendations. In the letter, which is reproduced in appendix VII, the Deputy Commissioner said that GAO\u2019s recommendations would provide IRS with additional opportunities for improving the identification of tax schemes involving exempt entities. IRS also sent us technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate. As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the report date. At that time, we will send copies to the appropriate congressional committees, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, and other interested parties. In addition, this report is available at no charge on the GAO website at http://www.gao.gov. If you or your staff have any questions about this report, please contact me at (202) 512-9110 or mctiguej@gao.gov. Contact points for our Offices of Congressional Relations and Public Affairs may be found on the last page of this report. GAO staff who made key contributions to this report are listed in appendix VIII. To describe ways in which taxpayers have abused a tax-exempt entity through abusive tax schemes, we conducted interviews with knowledgeable professionals and researchers. We chose the interview sources by reviewing relevant articles from academic databases and reaching out to professional organizations. We narrowed our list of examples of abusive tax schemes by focusing on those professionals and researchers who: had recent professional experience as an attorney, accountant, or other industry professional with a firm specializing in tax-exempt entities or tax shelters; had recent professional experience in nonprofit management or affiliation with professional associations specializing in nonprofit organization or oversight; had published books, articles, or other research on tax-exempt entities or tax shelters within the last 10 years; were recommended to us by a relevant professional organization, such as the American Bar Association or the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants; work for or previously worked in charity tax enforcement at the state previously worked for the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), specifically in the Tax Exempt and Government Entities Division (TE/GE); or would (in our professional judgment) be able to speak on the topics of abusive tax avoidance schemes or IRS investigations of tax-exempt entities. We conducted literature and court case reviews using academic and legal databases and covered years 2008 through 2018 using search terms such as \u201ctax avoidance,\u201d \u201ctax-exempt,\u201d and \u201cshelter.\u201d We combined the information found in interviews with reviews of relevant literature and court cases. We categorized the observations from our research by the following criteria. Involved multiple entities, at least one of which was tax exempt, and Involved a transaction or scheme already known to IRS, such as a listed transaction or transaction of interest or Involved a transaction mentioned in expert interviews. We then applied the following factors to make the final three choices for the examples: how representative the example was of abusive tax- schemes involving tax-exempt entities; how well-documented we found the example to be in literature reviews; how recent the example had been used by abusers; and how much impact the example had in terms of prevalence and tax revenues. To examine trends in IRS\u2019s compliance and the characteristics of taxpayers audited for using abusive tax schemes involving tax-exempt entities, we collected data from the following IRS business operating divisions that conduct audits on abusive transactions: (1) TE/GE, (2) Small Business/Self-Employed (SB/SE), and (3) Large Business and International (LB&I). We received data extracts from the following computer data systems (1) the Returns Inventory and Classification System data extracts from TE/GE; (2) the Automated Information Management System Centralized Information System (A-CIS), utilized by SB/SE and LB&I; and (3) the Compliance Data Warehouse (CDW) utilized by SB/SE and LB&I. IRS performs a number of quality control steps to verify the internal consistency of the Return Inventory Classification System, A-CIS, and CDW data. Additionally, we reviewed documentation from the operating divisions on the data, discussed the data with IRS officials, and conducted electronic reliability testing. For example, we verified the completeness of analysis variables and the date ranges for our analysis. We excluded 178 records from our analysis of SB/SE data because they were not within our date range. Based on our review, we believe the data are sufficiently complete and accurate for our purposes. We identified audits with potential tax exempt entities by selecting audits based on IRS project codes that IRS agreed were relevant to determine the minimum number of audits conducted on abusive schemes involving tax-exempt entities. We also matched the SB/SE and LB&I data with IRS\u2019s Form 8886, Reportable Transaction Disclosure Statement, data file of the tax-exempt records. We used these data to produce descriptive statistics on audit and taxpayer characteristics and IRS compliance efforts for 2008 through 2017. Tax return information came from Form 1040, U.S. Individual Income Tax Return; Form 1120, U.S. Corporation Income Tax Return; and Form 990, Return of Organization Exempt from Income Tax. Dollars amounts reported for the 10-year period have been adjusted for inflation in 2018 dollars based on a Fiscal Year, Gross Domestic Product Price index. Separately, we compiled descriptive statistics on disclosures of reportable transactions that also involved tax-exempt entities from Form 8886 and Form 8918, Material Advisor Disclosure Statement. IRS\u2019s Office of Tax Shelter Analysis provided the data for Forms 8886 and 8918. We also performed an analysis of the narrative portions of Form 8886 from tax year 2017 to identify more information about the descriptions of the reported transactions. We identified that IRS could conduct Python optical character recognition (OCR) analysis of the text fields on IRS Form 8886. We worked with officials at IRS\u2019s Research, Analysis and Statistics office on using Python computer programming language to conduct the analysis. IRS ran the OCR using keywords associated with 29 different tax-exempt organizations we identified. The keywords we used were based on characteristics of tax-exempt entities, such as \u201ccharity\u201d and \u201cfoundation\u201d\u2014 terms found in 26 U.S.C. Section 501. We received summary tables and copies of PDFs of all Form 8886-T, Disclosure by Tax-Exempt Entity Regarding Prohibited Tax Shelter Transaction, for tax years 2004 through 2016. We checked the reliability of IRS\u2019s summary tables and manually reviewed the PDF submissions to generate descriptions of the Form 8886-T data. We conducted reliability testing for all of the data we used for this objective. For the audit and tax return data, we interviewed relevant IRS officials and compared our statistical runs with publicly available statistics. For the Form 8886 and Form 8918 disclosure data, we interviewed relevant IRS officials. For the 8886-T data, we compared the summary tables IRS provided with the PDFs of the original Form 8886-T submissions. To assess how IRS identifies emerging abusive tax schemes and to identify potential improvements, we reviewed documentation on programs that help IRS identify possible abusive tax schemes involving tax-exempt entities. We identified the programs by reviewing IRS documentation, including the Internal Revenue Manual, in combination with IRS\u2019s determination of relevant programs (see appendix VI for more details about these programs). We then identified criteria appropriate for assessing the programs\u2019 alignment selected principles from Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government (Green Book) and leading practices from our Fraud Risk Management Framework. To select these criteria, we reviewed the Green Book and Fraud Risk Management Framework to identify principles relevant to specific aspects of IRS\u2019s programs for identifying and initiating enforcement actions against abusive tax schemes involving tax exempt entities. IRS agreed that these criteria were appropriate. The following list shows the criteria we selected through this process. Green Book Principle 3: Establish structure, responsibility, and Green Book Principle 4: Demonstrate a commitment to recruit, develop, and retain competent individuals Green Book Principle 7: Identify, analyze, and respond to risks Green Book Principle 8: Assess fraud risk GAO Fraud Risk Management Framework Overarching Concept 1.2 (structure) GAO Fraud Risk Management Framework Overarching Concept 2.1 (plans exist to assess fraud) Green Book Principle 10: Design control activities Green Book Principle 13: Use quality information Green Book Principle 14: Communicate Internally Green Book Principle 16: Perform Monitoring Activities After establishing appropriate criteria, two analysts independently reviewed appropriate evidence and determined whether the evidence aligned with the criteria for the programs was based on the attributes for the Green Book criteria and Fraud Risk Management Framework guidance. We also considered how the programs met TE/GE\u2019s objective to \u201cpromote the highest degree of voluntary compliance with the statutes governing qualification of plans and exemption of certain types of organizations from tax and to determine the extent of compliance and the causes of noncompliance with the tax laws by plans and organizations,\u201d and IRS\u2019s objective to \u201cidentify new types of tax transactions or promotions that are either abusive or potentially abusive requiring different levels of coordination and varying strategies.\u201d We determined the criterion was met only if all of the programs under review offered sufficient support. Table 1 shows how we assessed the programs we reviewed on the criteria. The federal tax code provides a variety of tax benefits to organizations often referred to as \u201ctax exempt.\u201d This appendix focuses on organizations or entities qualifying for a tax-exempt status under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 501. We discussed the tax benefits and requirements for different types of tax- exempt organizations in our 2014 report on oversight of charitable organizations. In addition to section 501, there are various other scattered provisions which give a full or partial tax exemption to certain specific types of entities and income. Section 501 distinguishes between charitable organizations, also known as 501(c)(3) organizations (after the subsection in which they are defined) from all other organizations qualifying for an exemption under section 501. Organizations that qualify for an exemption under section 501, but are not charitable organizations have been referred to as mutual benefit organizations or non-charitable nonprofits. Section 509 further divides charitable organizations between those that are private foundations and all other charitable organizations, and private foundations are divided between operating and nonoperating foundations in section 4942. Figure 9 shows the declines in the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s Tax- Exempt and Government Entities Division\u2019s budget since an increase from fiscal years 2009 through 2011. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) defines a transaction as one that includes all the factual elements relevant to the expected tax treatment of any investment, entity, plan, or arrangement, and it includes any series of steps carried out as part of a plan. Department of the Treasury (Treasury) regulations require that certain transactions be registered and that lists of investors be maintained by parties who organize or sell interests in the transaction. A transaction becomes \u201creportable\u201d (i.e., a taxpayer must disclose it to IRS on Form 8886) when it falls under one or more of the following categories: listed, confidential, contractual protection, loss transactions, and transactions of interest. Listed transactions: A listed transaction is reportable when it is the same or substantially similar to one of the types of transactions that IRS has determined to be an avoidance transaction. IRS provides a detailed list of the 36 recognized listed transactions on its website. Confidential transactions: A confidential transaction is offered to a taxpayer or a related party under conditions of confidentiality and is a type of transaction for which a taxpayer has paid a minimum advisor fee. A transaction is considered offered under conditions of confidentiality for two reasons: the advisor places a limitation on the taxpayer\u2019s disclosure of the tax treatment or tax structure of the transaction, and the limitation on disclosure protects the confidentiality of the advisor\u2019s tax strategies. The transaction is treated as confidential even if the conditions of confidentiality are not legally binding on the taxpayer. Contractual protection transactions: A contractual protection transaction is a transaction for which a taxpayer or a related party has the right to full or partial refund of fees if all or part of the tax consequences from the transaction are not sustained. It also includes a transaction for which fees are contingent on a taxpayer\u2019s realization of tax benefits from the transaction. Loss transactions: A loss transaction is a transaction that results in a taxpayer claiming a loss. The type of taxpaying individual or entity determines the applicable amount of the loss. The types of loss transactions IRS has described are as follows for: Individuals: at least $2 million in any single tax year or $4 million in any combination of tax years. Corporations (excluding S corporations): at least $10 million in any single tax year or $20 million in any combination of tax years. Partnerships with only corporations (excluding S corporations) as partners: at least $10 million in any single tax year or $20 million in any combination of tax years, whether or not any losses flow through to one or more partners. All other partnerships and S corporations: At least $2 million in any single tax year or $4 million in any combination of tax years, whether or not any losses flow through to one or more partners or stakeholders. Trusts: At least $2 million in any single tax year or $4 million in any combination of tax years, whether or not any losses flow through to one or more beneficiaries. Transactions of interest: A transaction of interest is one that IRS and Treasury believe to have the potential for tax avoidance or evasion, but which lacks enough information for IRS and Treasury to determine whether the transaction should be identified as a tax avoidance transaction. Tables 2 and 3 below show Internal Revenue Service (IRS) data for forms filed and audited, and the audit coverage rate, for individual income tax and corporate tax returns during fiscal years 2006 to 2017. Table 4 shows the number of returns processed and audited, and the audit coverage rate, for tax-exempt organizations during fiscal years 2006 to 2015. All three tables show declines in audit coverage rates: the decline occurred for individual income tax returns after fiscal year 2011 and for corporate income tax returns after fiscal year 2012. The audit coverage rate for tax-exempt organizations\u2019 returns declined from fiscal years 2013 to 2015, the last fiscal year for which we have complete data on tax- exempt organization returns.

    "human_reference": "Abusive tax schemes contribute to the tax gap and threaten the tax system's integrity. When abusive tax schemes involve tax-exempt entities, they also can erode the public's confidence in the charitable sector. GAO was asked to review what is known about abusive transactions involving tax-exempt entities and how IRS addresses them. This report, among other things, (1) describes ways in which taxpayers have abused an entity's tax-exempt status; (2) examines trends in IRS's compliance efforts; and (3) assesses how IRS identifies emerging abusive tax schemes involving tax-exempt entities. GAO reviewed research on tax schemes involving tax-exempt entities, and interviewed relevant professionals and researchers about tax schemes involving tax-exempt entities; compiled statistics from IRS audit and disclosure data; and compared documentation and testimony from IRS officials on IRS programs and guidance from its operating divisions with certain internal control and GAO fraud framework criteria. Taxpayers have used a variety of abusive tax schemes involving tax-exempt entities. In some schemes, the tax-exempt entity is complicit in the scheme, while in others it is not. For example, an abusive tax scheme could involve multiple donors grossly overvaluing charitable contributions, where the tax-exempt entity is not part of the scheme. Conversely, some patient assistance programs\u2014which can help patients obtain medical care or medications\u2014have been used by pharmaceutical manufacturers to make charitable donations that can be viewed as furthering private interests. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) audits of abusive tax schemes are trending downward, as the figure below shows audits by IRS's Large Business and International division. This trend has occurred amid generally declining IRS resources and corresponds with an overall decrease in audit activity by IRS over recent years. IRS has a variety of programs working collectively to identify abusive tax schemes involving tax-exempt entities, but some internal control weaknesses exist in its approach. For example, GAO found three ways that IRS data or programs were inconsistent with internal control standards for using quality information. First, database project codes used for identifying data on abusive tax schemes are not linked across IRS's audit divisions and do not consistently identify whether a tax-exempt entity was involved. Second, IRS has not leveraged a database with cross-divisional information to facilitate its analysis and monitoring of audit data across divisions. Finally, IRS has not used existing analytic tools to mine the narrative fields of tax forms. Doing so could provide audit leads on abusive schemes involving tax-exempt entities. These deficiencies inhibit IRS's ability to identify abusive tax schemes and develop responses to those schemes. GAO is making five recommendations to IRS to strengthen its internal controls, including that it link data across operating divisions, test the ability of a database to facilitate analysis of audit data, and use existing analytic tools to further mine information on tax forms. In commenting on a draft of this report, IRS agreed with all of GAO's recommendations.",

    "document": "epilepsy is a common and serious chronic neurological disease that affects over 50 million people worldwide . anti - epileptic drugs ( aeds ) are effective at controlling seizures in many patients , acting through a range of neuronal targets , including ion channels , neurotransmitter release , and receptor mechanisms.1 , 2 however , a third of patients with epilepsy fail to achieve seizure freedom , and current aeds do not show disease - modifying properties . future treatments for epilepsy need to differentiate from currently marketed drugs , for example , by having a novel mechanism(s ) of action or providing disease - modifying effects.1 , 2 acquired epilepsy is thought to result from disturbances to the expression and function of neurotransmitters and their receptors , ion channels , and signaling components , as well as altered metabolism , neuronal and glial microstructure , neuroinflammation , and other mechanisms.3 , 4 , 5 it is likely that disease - modifying treatments will need to influence multiple genes within a given pathway or in various independent pathways . potential gene network control points were recently identified and include master regulators of transcription and neuroinflammation , epigenetic factors , and noncoding rnas . micrornas ( mirnas ) are a conserved family of endogenous small noncoding rnas that regulate protein levels in cells by post - transcriptional control of mrna stability and translation.9 , 10 this is achieved by sequence - specific binding of the mirna to complementary bases in the mrna target . since this generally requires only a 7- to 8-nucleotide match , individual mirnas can potentially target large numbers of mrnas . this provides the ability to regulate entire gene networks or multiple biological processes and has been demonstrated in the brain . microrna-134 ( mir-134 ) was identified as a brain - enriched , neuronally expressed mirna that controls dendrite spine morphogenesis , via repression of lim domain kinase 1 and other targets.14 , 15 this is potentially important for disorders of hyperexcitability , since dendritic spines are contact points for excitatory communication and there is evidence that reorganization of dendrites is a feature of experimental and human epilepsy.16 , 17 we identified mir-134 among upregulated mirnas profiled in areas of hippocampal damage following status epilepticus induced by intra - amygdala kainic acid ( ka ) in mice . expression of mir-134 is also upregulated after neuronal stimulation and seizures in various other in  vitro and in  vivo models,15 , 19 , 20 , 21 , 22 and mir-134 is overexpressed in the resected human neocortex from patients with intractable temporal lobe epilepsy ( tle ) . silencing mir-134 by intracerebroventricular ( i.c.v . ) injection of locked nucleic acid ( lna ) , cholesterol - tagged antagomirs ( ant-134 ) reduced levels of mir-134 for at least a month and rendered mice refractory to the convulsant effects of both ka and pilocarpine.19 , 22 consistent with known mir-134 targets , lim domain kinase 1 and levels of other mir-134 targets were higher in ant-134-treated mice after status epilepticus and the dendritic spine volume was increased.19 , 22 notably , injection of ant-134 after status epilepticus suppressed the later occurrence of spontaneous recurrent seizures in the intra - amygdala ka model in mice . there is significant interest in developing mirna - based therapies.23 , 24 there are also barriers to antisense - based approaches and there has been some disengagement of industry from pursuing such efforts . this is likely to be a problem for any new therapy for epilepsy , particularly one that is not based on traditional small molecule chemistry.1 , 2 pre - clinical development of an mir-134-based treatment for epilepsy might be more attractive if additional important questions are answered . principally , work to date has only tested ant-134 in mouse models of status epilepticus . proof of seizure - suppressive effects of ant-134 in a non - status epilepticus model or in another species would bridge the gap in evidence and facilitate pre - clinical development of ant-134-based treatment for epilepsy.26 , 27 here , we evaluated mir-134 expression in the resected hippocampus from patients with pharmacoresistant tle and we tested ant-134 in three different models . we used the pentylenetetrazol ( ptz ) model in mice , a popular method for screening putative anticonvulsive effects that triggers seizures via -amino butyric acid ( gaba ) blockade.26 , 28 second , the perforant pathway stimulation ( pps ) model , a toxin - free model of acquired epilepsy based on nonconvulsive status epilepticus that avoids the confounding influence of exposing the brain to chemoconvulsants , was used in rats . finally , we used a high - potassium model of epileptiform activity , using ex  vivo brain slices from rats pre - treated with ant-134 . our results establish that targeting mir-134 offers broad anticonvulsant and possibly disease - modifying effects in experimental epilepsy , which may encourage pre - clinical development of ant-134 as a treatment for epilepsy . for this , we analyzed levels of mir-134 in the surgically obtained hippocampus from adults with pharmacoresistant tle and we compared findings to autopsy hippocampal samples from people who died of causes unrelated to neurological disease . these samples were used previously to analyze expression of other genes , and clinical data for both groups are briefly summarized in tables s1 and s2 . there were no between - group differences in patient age , and each group included males and females . we detected higher levels ( p  = 0.037 ) of mature mir-134 in the tle specimens compared to autopsy samples ( figure  1a ) . this difference is unlikely to be an artifact of post mortem delay , since mir-134 levels did not decrease in simulated autopsy experiments lasting up to 12  hr . we began by establishing dosing parameters in the mouse ptz model . generalized tonic - clonic seizures were first reliably elicited at a dose of 60  mg / kg in c57bl/6j mice ( figure  1b ) . a dose of 80  mg / kg elicited generalized tonic - clonic seizures in all mice and with a more consistent and shorter latency than with the 60 mg / kg dose ( figure  1b ) . a dose of 100  mg / kg also produced rapid - onset tonic - clonic seizures in all mice but was associated with high mortality ( figure  1b and data not shown ) . ordinal logistic regression analysis was used to explore the dose dependence of the ptz - induced convulsions . ptz dose was significantly associated with racine scores ( figure  1c ) . a dose of 80  mg / kg was selected for further experiments . to obtain molecular evidence for ptz - induced seizure activity in the model , we measured expression of activity - regulated genes in the hippocampus . transcript levels of fbj osteosarcoma oncogene ( fos ) , a calcium - dependent marker of neuronal activity and activity regulated cytoskeletal - associated protein ( arc ) , another immediate early gene responsive to intense neuronal activity , were strongly increased in the hippocampus 30  min , but not at 4  hr , after ptz - induced seizures ( figures 1d and 1e ) . there was no evidence of irreversible neuronal injury in tissue sections from mice after ptz , as assessed by fluoro - jade b ( fjb ) and neun ( rna binding protein , fox-1 homolog [ c.  elegans ] 3 ) staining ( data not shown ) . expression of mir-134 is known to increase in various in  vitro and in  vivo seizure models.15 , 19 , 20 , 21 , 22 we therefore investigated whether ptz - induced convulsions alter mir-134 levels in mice . taqman mirna assays showed that levels of mature mir-134 were significantly increased in the hippocampus , but not in the cortex , 30  min after ptz - induced generalized tonic - clonic seizures in mice ( figure  1f and data not shown ) . injection of antagomirs targeting mir-134 ( ant-134 ) in mice.19 , 22 previous work has established a dose of these antagomirs that reduces hippocampal mir-134 levels by over 90% by 24  hr after injection . accordingly , we tested ptz responses 24  hr after injection of ant-134 and compared them to responses in mice that received a scrambled antagomir ( scr ) . in scr mice , delay to onset of first tonic - clonic seizure after ptz injection was similar to that observed before in control mice ( figure  2a , and compare to figure  1b ) . thus , the control antagomir did not alter the normal response to ptz in the model . the time to first ptz - induced tonic - clonic seizure was significantly longer in mice injected with ant-134 compared to scr - injected animals ( figure  2a ) . the severity of racine - scored ptz - induced seizures was also significantly lower in ant-134- compared to scr - injected mice ( figures 2b and 2c ) . analysis of electrographically recorded seizure activity determined that electroencephalography ( eeg ) total power was lower in ant-134 mice compared to the control group after ptz ( figure  2d ) . we next analyzed brain tissue samples from scr- and ant-134-injected mice for evidence of mirna silencing and differences in expression of activity - regulated genes . analysis of the hippocampus obtained after ptz - induced seizures confirmed that mir-134 expression was lower in ant-134 pre - treated mice compared to scr - treated animals ( figure  3a ) . ant-134 had no effect on levels of an unrelated mirna ( figure  3b ) . next , we assessed expression of arc and c - fos as molecular markers of recent neuronal activity to support the clinically scored behavior and eeg differences in ant-134 mice . quantitative real - time pcr analysis revealed increased c - fos expression in the hippocampus of scr - injected mice after ptz - induced seizures ( figure  3c ) . in contrast , c - fos levels were lower in ant-134-injected mice , consistent with reduced seizure severity ( figure  3c ) . this difference was also apparent in the neocortex from the same animals ( figure  3c ) . expression of arc was increased in the hippocampus of scr - injected mice that received ptz . arc levels were not significantly different in ant-134 mice compared to scr - injected animals in the hippocampus and neocortex after ptz - induced seizures ( figure  3d ) . we turned next to the pps model in rats , first investigating effects on mir-134 levels . taqman mirna assays showed that levels of mature mir-134 were not significantly modified in the hippocampus of rats at two different time points ( figure  4a ) . next , we assessed the effect of silencing mir-134 before stimulation on seizure severity during status epilepticus . rats were pre - treated with ant-134 or scr ( i.c.v . ) 24  hr before the 8-hr stimulation protocol . analysis of electrographically recorded seizure activity determined that scr - injected rats presented a mean (  sem ) increase of 1,304.3%   94.9% in eeg total power relative to baseline . this was similar to animals that were stimulated but not receiving the oligonucleotide ( data not shown ) . in rats pre - treated with ant-134 , the severity of evoked seizures in the pps model was similar : eeg total power during seizures was a mean (  s.e.m ) of 1,244.6%   82.7% ( percent of baseline ) . despite not seeing an acute anticonvulsant effect of ant-134 in the pps model , we were nevertheless interested in whether silencing mir-134 after status epilepticus in the model would alter the emergence of recurrent spontaneous seizures . a key prior finding was that silencing mir-134 after status epilepticus induced by intra - amygdala ka reduced the subsequent occurrence of spontaneous recurrent seizures by over 90% . for these studies , rats underwent 8-hr stimulation of the perforant pathway to induce epilepsy and the i.c.v . rats were then monitored with video - eeg until a first spontaneous seizure was recorded , typically 1025  days after pps , and they were then followed for a further 8  weeks ( figure  4b ) . epilepsy developed in all scr - injected rats over the expected course , with the first spontaneous seizures appearing 14  weeks after status epilepticus ( figures 4b and 4c ) . scr - injected rats averaged 20 spontaneous seizures recorded during the 8-week recording time ( figures 4d and 4e ) . in contrast , no spontaneous seizures were detected over the 8-week period in six of seven rats injected with ant-134 after status epilepticus ( figures 4d4f ) . epilepsy emerged in only a single rat treated with ant-134 ( figures 4d and 4f ) . the fisher exact test determined that there was a significant difference in epilepsy development between the groups ( p  = 0.005 ) . in terms of effect size , ant-134 prevented 86% of the risk of epilepsy , with a 95% confidence interval ( ci ) of 12%98% . an analysis of the duration of spontaneous seizures ( electrographically defined ) revealed that when spontaneous seizures occurred , they were similar between groups . that is , the average duration of a spontaneous seizure in scr - treated rats was 53.7   14.4  s ( n  = 20 seizures , from five rats ) , which was similar to the duration in epileptic rats in the pps model that did not receive an i.c.v . injection ( 49.4   15.9 , n  = 20 seizures ) . in the ant-134 rat that developed epilepsy , the average duration of a spontaneous seizure was 52.3   16.2  s ( from n  = 12 seizures ) . having observed a disparity between the acute anti - seizure effects of ant-134 pre - treatment in the ptz and pps models , we sought to examine the effect of ant-134 on naive , non - epileptic tissue and whether the effects were due to long range networks or if local circuitry was sufficient to mediate any seizure protection . we injected ant-134 in  vivo in rats and subsequently prepared ex  vivo brain slices ( figure  5a ) . these slices were then exposed to a 9-mm k seizure challenge , to determine whether ant-134 protects against epilepsy in local circuits of the isolated slice in the absence of epileptogenesis . onset of activity was delayed in ant-134-treated slices by 176  s relative to the control ( figures 5b and 5c ) . this effect was statistically significant ( mann - whitney u test , p  = 0.002 ,   = 0.025 , power  = 0.87 ) . we also compared the power of epileptiform activity and duration of seizure - like events in these data ; these effects were not statistically significant ( power : t test , p  = 0.70 ; duration : mann - whitney u test , p  = 0.067 ) . this finding suggests that ant-134 can confer seizure resistance in naive tissue and thus mediate its effect even in the absence of epileptogenesis . in addition , preservation of the seizure resistance in isolated slices indicates that at least some of the effects of ant-134 are due to local changes in activity . the present study provides important additional evidence of the anticonvulsant and disease - modifying effects of lna - based antagomirs targeting mir-134 in animal models of epilepsy . our study shows that ant-134 is an anticonvulsant in an acute chemoconvulsant model ( ptz in mice ) and ant-134 had anti - epileptogenic activity in the perforant pathway stimulation model of epilepsy in rats . ant-134 also confers resistance to epileptic activity in naive tissue , reflected as a delay to activity onset following a seizure challenge in ex  vivo brain slices . we also report that mir-134 levels are elevated in the hippocampus of patients with pharmacoresistant tle . the therapeutic potential of targeting mir-134 in established epilepsy will require additional studies , but our findings may encourage further research or pre - clinical development of this mirna - based treatment for epilepsy . despite the recent introduction of two additional aeds ( perampanel and brivaracetam ) , new drug development in epilepsy faces significant challenges.1 , 2 , 32 new targets are required that can treat pharmacoresistant patients or have disease - modifying effects that are not served by current therapies . mirnas have emerged as potential targets of the future via their influence on neuronal microstructure , gliosis , neuroinflammation , and ion channels.8 , 33 silencing mir-134 has produced the most convincing anti - seizure effects to date , reducing status epilepticus in pre - treatment paradigms in the intra - amygdala ka and pilocarpine models and exerting potent long - term effects on spontaneous seizure development.19 , 22 this mirna is also an attractive target , since studies show increased levels of mir-134 within the temporal lobe of adult and pediatric patients with intractable epilepsy.19 , 20 we report here that mir-134 is also elevated in the hippocampus of adults with pharmacoresistant tle , although there are potential confounders with comparing resected material from patients to autopsy control samples . the present study has answered key questions that could facilitate pre - clinical development by showing that ant-134 has anticonvulsant effects in non - status epilepticus models and is disease modifying in another species . the first important finding was that pre - treatment with ant-134 strongly suppressed seizures in the mouse ptz model . effects on both clinical behavior , including delaying the time to first convulsive seizure , and electrographic seizure activity were seen . thus , lowering brain levels of mir-134 can exert anti - excitability effects , and this implies that mir-134 has a role in setting excitability thresholds in the brain . this is thought to be due to regulation of proteins that control dendritic morphology,14 , 15 although other targets are known . ant-134 did not fully prevent seizures in the ptz model ; rather , it delayed and minimized their severity , a finding most closely matching the effect of ant-134 in the pilocarpine model of status epilepticus . it may not be possible to fully prevent all seizures using ant-134 in chemoconvulsant models , but further adjustments to antagomir dose or delivery may yield optimal seizure - suppressive effects . ptz triggers seizures via gabaergic blockade ; this differs from the mechanism by which status epilepticus is induced by ka and pilocarpine , which work by promoting glutamatergic and cholinergic transmission , respectively . this suggests that ant-134 may be effective for epilepsies of various etiologies , which , in patients , can vary considerably between trauma , stroke , infection , genetic , and other causes . our studies also show that ptz - induced convulsions increase brain levels of mir-134 , transcription of which is probably mediated by myocyte enhancer factor 2c . we did not observe an increase in mir-134 after perforant pathway stimulation in the rat . this was surprising , although changes to mir-134 levels are not always detected after chemoconvulsive stimuli , and we can not rule out a technical explanation ( e.g. , the time points selected or a subfield - specific effect that was masked by the use of the whole hippocampus ) . our study included an analysis of the short - term effects of ant-134 on neuronal activity - regulated genes in the ptz model . expression of genes such as c - fos and arc is a well - established surrogate marker of recent seizure activity , the protein products of which are involved in coordinating synaptic plasticity and adaptation to excessive neuronal stimulation.38 , 39 unexpectedly , only levels of c - fos , and not arc , showed the expected reductions in ant-134 mice after ptz seizures . it is known that c - fos induction is calcium dependent , whereas arc expression can be induced via calcium - independent pathways.38 , 39 therefore , ant-134 treatment may have reduced seizure severity sufficient to prevent c - fos induction , such as by minimizing n - methyl - d - aspartate ( nmda ) receptor opening , but enough residual neuronal excitation remained to upregulate arc . these findings provide additional evidence of the scale and nature of seizure suppression by ant-134 and suggest molecular markers that can distinguish effects of mirna manipulations on different components of seizure responses . in the present study , we observed that pre - treatment of rats with ant-134 did not protect against perforant pathway stimulation - induced status epilepticus . while there are examples of anticonvulsants producing effects in some but not all models , these findings suggest that ant-134 may have the most clinical value as an anti - epileptogenic treatment . previous work showed that injection of ant-134 after status epilepticus in mice suppressed the later occurrence of spontaneous seizures by 90% , evidence of a disease - modifying effect in the intra - amygdala ka model . here , we found nearly identical anti - epileptogenic effects of ant-134 in a different model in rats . this is the only demonstration , to our knowledge , of any disease - modifying treatment in the pps model in rats . the pps technique induces hippocampal sclerosis and recurrent spontaneous seizures,29 , 40 and it provides a means to trigger epilepsy without the bias or other issues associated with chemoconvulsants . ant-134 was injected shortly after triggering status epilepticus in order to model a reasonably realistic clinical scenario , such as a patient being treated shortly after an initial precipitating injury . ant-134 had dramatic and potent effects , with the majority of ant-134 rats ( six of seven , 86% ) never developing spontaneous recurrent seizures . notably , spontaneous seizures in the study with the intra - amygdala ka model did occur in all ant-134 mice , albeit with dramatically lower seizure frequency . this difference may relate to the extent of hippocampal injury or another aspect of the epileptic phenotype , such as the frequency of spontaneous seizures . thus , presently we see a possible additional therapeutic action of ant-134 , whereby post - treatment is capable of fully preventing epilepsy at least in some models . we can not , of course , exclude that epilepsy might have developed in some of the ant-134 rats at some point in the future . however , we recorded for 8  weeks beyond the standard latent period . we further corroborated the anti - seizure effect of ant-134 by using an acute seizure challenge with high potassium in otherwise healthy ( ex  vivo ) tissue . inhibitory neurotransmission is retained in this model ( in contrast to ptz ) and there is no hippocampal sclerosis ( unlike pps ) , further suggesting that ant-134 can be therapeutic in multiple epileptic syndromes with varying mechanisms . we observed a delay in the onset of epileptiform bursts in brain slices that had been pre - treated with ant-134 . this finding suggests that epileptogenesis is not required for ant-134 to mediate its effects on seizure onset . we did not see any significant changes in the power or duration of epileptiform activity ; however , these parameters are highly variable in brain slices , which can obscure potential effects . in addition , we propose that ant-134 can mediate seizure protection in the hippocampus via effects on local circuitry , because long range connections would likely be severed during the slicing process . the anti - epileptogenic actions of ant-134 may be independent of the etiology of the initial precipitating injury , although this will require further testing ( e.g. , in models of trauma or infection - induced epilepsy ) . in addition , upregulation of mir-134 is not essential for ant-134 to produce anti - epileptogenic effects , since mir-134 levels were not altered after pps - induced status epilepticus . thus , epilepsy can be dramatically suppressed in two different in  vivo models , and one in  vitro , in two different species . this provides strong support for and is an argument for further development of ant-134 for epilepsy treatment or prevention . antagomirs targeting a liver - expressed mirna have been given to humans and were found to be well tolerated and effective against hepatitis c in clinical trials . there are concerns , obviously , that because ant-134 can alter dendritic spines , it could have effects on cognition . studies to date have not identified such problems , with natural exploratory behavior and performance in a hippocampus - dependent task found to be normal in mice a few days after i.c.v . injection of ant-134.19 , 22 however , more demanding tests of cognition or learning will need to be performed . another factor that argues for general safety is that mice and rats have been recorded for at least 2  months after brain injections of ant-134 . nevertheless , pre - clinical development will necessitate an extensive battery of toxicity and safety testing . work to date on ant-134 satisfies certain recommendations for testing and evaluating novel therapies for epilepsy , with seizure - suppressive effects demonstrated in five different models and two different species.1 , 2 , 43 , 44 there are , however , additional seizure models that could be used during any future pre - clinical development . this includes kindling , a popular model that has been successful in identifying aeds with novel mechanisms of action . while this is not an essential step before pre - clinical development , sex differences in mirna inhibitor responses may be worth investigating in future studies and sexual dimorphism in mirna expression has been reported , although not for mir-134.46 , 47 it will also be of value to understand how ant-134 produces its potent seizure - suppressive effects . the most likely mechanism is upregulation of one or more proteins due to de - repression of a mir-134 target . previous work has shown that mir-134 is uploaded into the rna - induced silencing complex after seizures , which facilitates targeting of mrnas , and in  vitro studies suggest that the neuroprotective effects of ant-134 are due to de - repression of lim domain kinase 1 . ant-134 treatment also increases dendritic spine volume and changes spine number in the hippocampus,19 , 22 which could influence excitability and would also be consistent with a mechanism involving protection of mir-134 targets such as lim domain kinase 1 or pumilio rna - binding family member 2 . altered spine volume and number is consistent with our observation of a robust local effect of suppressing mir-134 on delaying epileptiform activity , although additional effects on long range connections can not be ruled out . we must also consider that the acute seizure - suppressive effects and long - term anti - epileptogenesis effects may arise from different mechanisms . ultimately , in  vivo studies will be necessary to determine the anti - seizure mechanism of ant-134 ( e.g. , by analyzing gene expression networks , quantifying the proteome , and applying techniques to validate antagomir - mirna targeting such as polysome shift assays ) . what are the next steps for translation or pre - clinical development ? an obvious question is whether and how antagomirs could be given to patients . their large size precludes their passing an intact blood - brain barrier ( bbb ) . recent work has explored methods to circumvent the bbb , including conjugating antagomirs with brain - penetrating peptides or administering antagomirs via intranasal injection.19 , 51 the bbb may also be open after certain epilepsy - precipitating injuries or it can be physically breached , such as through use of ultrasound . another question is whether ant-134 injection into already epileptic animals could alter the frequency or duration of spontaneous seizures or attendant hippocampal pathology . success with that approach could provide novel treatment opportunities for the population of drug - resistant patients for whom surgery or other alternatives to aeds are either not possible or not effective currently . in summary , the present study provides important additional validation of the potent seizure - suppressive and possibly disease - modifying effects of ant-134 in two different animal models and one brain slice model . the effectiveness of ant-134 and the potency of seizure suppression suggest a target for drug development in epilepsy that could provide additional effects beyond those provided by any currently marketed drug for epilepsy . this study was approved by the ethics ( medical research ) committee of beaumont hospital of dublin ( no . 05/18 ) and written informed consent was obtained from all patients . the control ( autopsy ) hippocampus ( n  = 12 ) was obtained from 12 individuals . patients ( n  = 12 ) were referred for surgical resection of the temporal lobe by an epileptologist ( n.d . ) following neurological assessment , video - eeg recording , and mri / neuroimaging . each patient was determined to have medically intractable tle with a history of recurring seizures ( table s2 ) . the hippocampus was obtained and a portion of each specimen was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 70c until use . a pathologist ( m.a.f . ) assessed the  hippocampus as part of the pathologic evaluation , addressed the degree of hippocampal sclerosis , and described other pathologic changes . all animal experiments were performed in accordance with the european communities council directive ( 2010/63/eu ) . procedures in mice were approved by the research ethics committee of the royal college of surgeons in ireland ( rec-842 ) , under license from the ireland health products regulatory authority ( ae19127/001 ) . procedures in rats were performed under authorization of the philipps university bioethics committee and were approved by the local regulation authority ( regierungsprsidium gieen ) , or they were performed according to the uk animals ( scientific procedures ) 1986 act ( ppl 70 - 7684 ) and approved by local ethical review ( university college london ) . male adult c57bl/6j mice ( 2025 g ) and male sprague - dawley rats ( 325350  g or 200300 g ; all from harlan ) were used in all studies . animals were housed in on - site barrier - controlled facilities having a 12-hr/12-hr light / dark cycle with ad libitum access to food and water . mice were equipped for eeg recordings under surgical anesthesia ( isoflurane ; 5% induction , 1%2% maintenance ) in a mouse - adapted stereotaxic frame . body temperature was maintained within the normal physiological range with a feedback - controlled heat pad ( harvard apparatus ) . after a midline scalp incision , partial craniectomies were performed and animals had skull - mounted recording electrodes placed and fixed with dental cement . a second cohort of mice had eeg electrodes and a guide cannula implanted to allow i.c.v . this cannula was placed on the dura mater with the following coordinates from the bregma : anterior - posterior ( ap ) ,  + 0.3  mm ; lateral ( l ) ,  + 0.9  mm ; and ventral ( v ) , 2.0  mm . after recovery from surgery , mice were connected to the lead socket of a swivel commutator , which was connected to a grass twin digital eeg system . ] ) with different doses of ptz ( 60 , 80 , or 100  mg / kg ) . lorazepam ( 8  mg / kg , i.p . ) was administered after the first tonic - clonic seizure to reduce morbidity and mortality . mice were followed for 30  min or 4  hr after ptz administration for the appearance of seizures by electrographic and behavioral methods . after the observation period , mice were deeply anesthetized ( pentobarbital ) and transcardially perfused , and their brains were removed for analysis of gene expression or histological assessment . injection of 0.12  nmol/2  l 3-cholesterol - tagged locked nucleic acid oligonucleotide targeting mir-134 ( ant-134 ) or its respective control , a non - targeting scrambled version of the antagomir ( scr ; 0.12  nmol/2  l ) ( exiqon a / s ) , as previously described.19 , 22 twenty - four hours later , mice were connected to an eeg system and a baseline recording was obtained . next , mice were injected with ptz ( 80  mg / kg , i.p . ) . lorazepam ( 8  mg / kg , i.p . ) was administered after the first tonic - clonic seizure to reduce morbidity and mortality . these mice were followed up for 30  min after ptz administration for the appearance of seizures . after this period , mice were deeply anesthetized ( pentobarbital overdose ) and transcardially perfused ( pbs ) for further assessments . under isoflurane ( 5% induction , 3% maintenance ) anesthesia , bipolar stainless - steel stimulating electrodes ( nex-200 ; rhodes medical instruments ) were positioned in the angular bundles of the perforant pathway and custom unipolar recording electrodes ( crafted from 796000 ; a - m systems ) were lowered into the dorsal dentate gyrus . electrodes and ground screws were connected to miniature wireless transmitters ( ft20 ; data sciences international ) that were implanted subcutaneously on the animal s flank . plastic connectors ( gs09plg ; ginder scientific ) joined the electrodes with stimulation / recording equipment . the pps protocol utilized a paradigm designed to evoke and maintain hippocampal seizure activity throughout the stimulation , but not convulsive status epilepticus , which consisted of continuous , bilateral 2-hz paired - pulse stimuli , with a 40-ms interpulse interval , plus a 10-s train of 20  hz single - pulse stimuli delivered once per minute , generated by an s88 stimulator ( grass instruments ) . all pulses ( 0.1-ms duration ) were delivered at 2024 v , as this voltage reliably evokes granule cell discharging without tissue - damaging hydrolysis.29 , 40 the current associated with these voltages was typically between 15 and 30  a . no samples displayed any signs of hydrolysis ( e.g. , holes around the stimulating electrodes ) . as described previously , stimulation for 30  min ( on 2 consecutive days ) required only isoflurane to terminate seizures . eight - hour stimulation on the third day did not induce convulsive status epilepticus and , therefore , did not require pharmacological termination . rats were randomly divided in three cohorts to assess the following : ( 1 ) mir-134 expression after pps ( 24  hr , 4  days , and 14  days ) ; ( 2 ) the effect of ant-134 on pps - induced status epilepticus , in which rats were pre - treated with ant-134 or scr ( 0.36  nmol/6  l , i.c.v . ; exiqon a / s ) 24  hr before the 8-hr stimulation ; and ( 3 ) the effect of ant-134 on epileptogenesis , in which rats were injected with 0.36  nmol/6  l ( i.c.v . ) of ant-134 or scr ( exiqon a / s ) immediately after 8-hr stimulation . five rats were excluded from this study due to practical issues ( e.g. , blocked cannula ) . for statistical purposes , we pooled samples from 24  hr and 4  days after pps as an  early  time point , while 14-day samples were considered as the  late  time point . mouse eeg data were analyzed and quantified using labchart 8 software ( ad instruments ) . ptz - induced seizures were defined as high - amplitude ( > 2 baseline ) high - frequency ( > 5  hz ) polyspike discharges lasting > 5 s. for statistical purposes , we assigned a cut - off time of 1,800  s for those animals that did not present seizures during the observation period . from the eeg recordings , we calculated the delay to first seizure , the total power , and the percentage of total power / spectral bands , as previously described.19 , 54 eeg total power was plotted as the percentage of baseline recording ( each animal s eeg power post - seizure compared to its own baseline eeg ) . clinical behavior was scored using the following adapted racine scale : score 0 , no seizures observed ; score 1 , rhythmic mouth and facial movement ; score 2 , rhythmic head nodding ( bobbing ) ; score 3 , forelimb clonus ; score 4 , rearing and bilateral forelimb clonus ; and score 5 , rearing and falling ( stay fallen on rear side ; tonic - clonic seizures ) . the highest score reached during every 5  min during the 30  min after ptz was recorded . for studies in rats , eeg activity during and after pps was amplified and recorded digitally at 2 khz utilizing a powerlab 16/35 and labchart software versions 7 and 8 ( ad instruments ) . spontaneous granule cell layer activity was recorded continuously ( 24 hr / day ) and stored digitally and automatically in 3-hr epochs . each day , we analyzed the preceding 24  hr of recordings , as well as all events with amplitudes exceeding 120% of average baseline . continuous ( 24 hour/7  day ) video monitoring utilized edimax  7010w infrared cameras . video files were captured at 1215  frames / sec and were time - stamped for integration with the electrophysiological data using securityspy surveillance software ( ben software ) and stored digitally . confirmed seizures were scored according to the racine scale . rats were anesthetized with isoflurane ( 5% induction,2% maintenance as appropriate ) and mounted in a stereotaxic frame . we injected ant-134 ( 0.12  nmol ) in 1  l te buffer ( life technologies ) at coordinates relative to the bregma : ap , 0.92  mm ; medial - lateral ( ml ) ,  + 1.3  mm , and dorsal - ventral ( dv ) , 3.3  mm to target the lateral ventricle . to allow the rats to fully recover from the analgesic drugs and to coincide with the maximal anti - epileptic effect seen in  vivo sodium pentobarbital and transcardially perfused with ice - cold sucrose artificial cerebrospinal fluid ( acsf ; in mm : 205 sucrose , 10 glucose , 2.5 kcl , 0.1 cacl2 , 5 mgcl2 , 26 nahco3 , and 1.2 nah2po4.h2o ; osmolarity , 295 mosm ) . the brain was quickly dissected into ice - cold sucrose acsf and transferred to a campden 700 smz slicer ( campden instruments ) . slices ( 400  m ) were prepared in the horizontal orientation between the bregma at approximately 7.1 and  5.1  mm . for storage , slices were submerged in oxygenated normal acsf ( in mm : 125 nacl , 10 glucose , 3 kcl , 1 mgcl2 , 2 cacl2 , 26 nahco3 , and 1.25 nah2po4.h2o ; osmolarity , 290 mosm ) and allowed to recover at room temperature for at least 60  min prior to recordings . slice recordings were made using a membrane chamber ( scientific systems design ) , a modified submerged chamber , which improves oxygen supply to the tissue and supports greater epileptiform bursts than conventional submerged recording chambers . slices were continually perfused with acsf , heated to 32c , at a flow rate of 16  ml / min . for local field potential ( lfp ) recordings , borosilicate glass recording micropipettes ( resistance , 34 m ) were placed into hippocampal ca1b stratum pyramidale and epileptiform activity was induced by raising the perfusing kcl concentration to 9  mm . total rna was isolated from brain samples using trizol ( invitrogen ) , as described previously.19 , 54 for mrna qpcr , 1  g total rna was used to generate cdna by reverse transcription using the superscript iii reverse transcriptase enzyme ( invitrogen ) . the pcr amplification was performed for 50 cycles on a thermocycler ( applied biosystems ) . quantitative real - time pcr was performed using a lightcycler 1.5 ( roche diagnostics ) in combination with quantitect sybr green pcr kit ( qiagen ) as per the manufacturer s protocol with 25  m of primer pairs used . specific primers for each gene assayed were purchased from sigma and sequences used were as follows : actin , beta ( actb ) ( forward [ f ] , ggttggccttagggttcagg ; reverse [ r ] , gggtgtgatggtgggaatgg ) ; c - fos ( f , cattcagaccacctcgacaa ; r , ggaattaacctggtgctgga ) ; and arc ( f , agcagcagacctgacatcct ; r , gtgatgccctttccagacat ) . data were normalized to actb and relative mrna transcript levels were quantified using the ct method . for mirna , 250  ng rna was reverse transcribed using stem - loop specific primers for mmu - mir-134 ( applied biosystems ) and real - time quantitative pcr was carried out on a 7900ht fast real - time system ( applied biosystems ) using taqman mirna assays . expression of rnu19 was used for normalization . a relative fold change in expression of mir-134 was determined using the ct method.19 , 56 specific mirna assays were obtained from thermofisher scientific for mir-134 ( i d 001186 ) , mir-19a ( i d 000395 ) , and rnu19 ( i d 001003 ) . data were normalized to rnu19 and relative mirna expression levels were quantified using the ct method . statistical analysis was performed using graphpad prism and stata release 14 software , and a p value  < 0.05 was considered significant . latencies to tonic - clonic seizures were analyzed by the kruskal - wallis test , followed by the nonparametric dunn multiple comparison test when indicated . total time spent in seizures , mean amplitude , frequency , total power of eeg recordings , and mrna levels were analyzed by the student t test or one -

    "document": "Speaker 2: Moved and seconded public hearing 322 is now open. And may we have the staff report.\nSpeaker 4: Good evening, Mr. President.\nSpeaker 11: Members of City Council. My name is Tracy Huggins. I'm the executive director of the Denver Urban Renewal Authority. Get comfortable. I only have about 45 pages of text that I need to.\nSpeaker 6: Just kidding to go through. But there are a number.\nSpeaker 11: Of things that we do need to cover to make sure that this amendment is undertaken consistent with the urban renewal statute. So we are here this evening to ask your consideration of an amendment to the Walton Corridor Urban Redevelopment Plan to add the 2560 Welton Street Project and to create the 2560.\nSpeaker 4: Welton.\nSpeaker 11: Street property tax and sales tax increment areas. The Walton Corridor Urban Redevelopment Plan was approved by City Council in September of 2012. In doing so, council.\nSpeaker 6: Found the Walton Corridor.\nSpeaker 11: Urban Redevelopment Plan to be in conformance with the Denver Comprehensive Plan 2000 and is applicable supplements. While the Urban Redevelopment Plan authorizes the use of tax increment financing, TIFF cannot be used until it is specifically approved for a project. Therefore, again, we are here this evening requesting your consideration of an amendment to the Walton Corridor Urban Redevelopment Plan to add the 2560 Walton Walton Street Project. Create the 2560 Walton Street Property Tax Increment Increment Area and Sales Tax Increment Area, as well as to amend certain definitions in particular the definition of property tax increment to conform with statutory changes due to the passage of House Bill 15 1348. In addition to the Urban Redevelopment Plan Amendment, there are those three companion ordinances that will be considered following council action on the plan amendment. These include Council Bill 323 to approve the 2560 Walton Street Sales Tax Increment and Property Tax Increment Cooperation Agreement Council Bill 324 to approve the Intergovernmental Agreement among the City, Denver Public Schools and Borough and Council Bill 325 to approve the letter agreement among the city, urban drainage and flood control and dra. And each of these bills will be discussed later in my presentation. The Walton Corridor Urban Redevelopment Area, again, was established in 2012 for the purpose of encouraging redevelopment.\nSpeaker 6: Along the Welton Corridor.\nSpeaker 11: The urban redevelopment area is comprised of approximately 29 blocks, generally in approximately Brown bounded by Broadway Street on the West Glenarm Place and 24th Avenue on the South. Downing Street on the East and on the north. By either California street or the alley between Welton and California streets. At the time the plan was originally approved, no projects were identified. However, the plan allowed for future projects to request tax increment assistance and contemplated tax increment areas that would be approved as projects were brought forward within the urban redevelopment area. To date, three projects have been approved. An affordable.\nSpeaker 4: Housing.\nSpeaker 11: Development project at 2300 Welton. A mixed use project I'm sorry, a mixed income residential project at 2460. Welton and a mixed use project at 28 a well 2801 Welton. The project being considered through the amendment this evening is the redevelopment of the site located at 2560 Welton Street. The project site is located at the southern corner of Welton Street and 25th Street. And the site is currently vacant and owned by the developer, a joint venture between Palisade Partners and Confluence companies. And as you can see on this slide, the site is located at the light rail stop at 25th and Welton. The project is comprised of an eight story steel and concrete building to include 129 apartment units.\nSpeaker 4: With 22.\nSpeaker 11: Units restricted to 80% of the area. Median income or AMI will also include approximately 10,000 square feet of ground floor retail and approximately 15,000 square feet of second floor office space. The project will also include 185 parking stalls within a structured parking garage. 27 of these parking spaces will be accessed from the alley, while the remaining 158 spaces will be accessed from 26th Street. The site is zoned CMC's eight Urban Center Mixed Use Up to eight.\nSpeaker 4: Stories is.\nSpeaker 11: Located in the Five Points Historic Cultural District and is immediately adjacent to the 2015 Wilton Light Rail stop after planning and neighborhood outreach efforts, including consultation with the Landmark Preservation Commission. There was general support for the proposed height of the building and the total cost of this project is expected to be just over $40 million. The apartments. Premier units range in size from 606 square feet, four studios to 1563 square feet for three bedrooms. The unit mix includes 12 studios, 94 one bedroom units, 19 two bedroom units and four three bedroom units. Market rate rents are expected to range from $1,250 per month to 2006 $2,630, depending on this on the unit size . 22 units, four studios, 16 one bedroom and two two.\nSpeaker 4: Bedrooms.\nSpeaker 11: Will be affordable at 80% AMI. And this.\nSpeaker 6: Affordability requirement.\nSpeaker 11: Will be in effect for not less than 25 years. The Urban Redevelopment Plan authorizes Darra to finance projects within the urban redevelopment area by the use of tax increment financing. The Urban Redevelopment Plan Amendment will add the 2561 street property tax increment and sales tax increment areas. Each of these will derive their incremental taxes just from the project site. Dora staff has reviewed the budgets and pro forma submitted by the RE developer and believes there is a financing gap in the project of $4.2 million. This financing gap will be addressed through property tax increment and sales tax increment again generated by the redevelopment of the property. The site is currently owned by the developer who is paying approximately $31,000 per year today in property taxes. This amount will constitute the base taxes from which property tax increment will be calculated. The estimated taxable value following redevelopment and the sales taxes generated by the retail component are anticipated to generate approximately $481,000 per year in net property and sales tax increment. These incremental tax revenues will be used to reimburse the developer for eligible expenses of $4.2 million over 25 years.\nSpeaker 6: Let's skip that.\nSpeaker 11: One. As noted previously, City Council found the urban redevelopment plan to be in conformance with the planned and is applicable supplements. Accordingly, any amendment to the Urban Redevelopment Plan must also be in conformance with the Urban Redevelopment Plan objectives. To maintain the continuing conformance with comp plan 2000. The general objectives of the Walton Corridor Urban Renewal Plan. Or to reduce or eliminate blighted conditions and to stimulate the continued growth and development of the urban redevelopment area. The proposed projects meets the following objectives of the Walton Corridor Urban Redevelopment Plan, and I'm certainly not going to walk through all of these, but just highlight several of those, including the objective, to eliminate the present and growing factors which contribute to the blight in the urban redevelopment area to encourage residential, retail and commercial development and redevelopment that is socially and economically inclusive and from which the urban redevelopment area and its environs can draw economic strength to more effectively use underdeveloped land within the urban redevelopment area to encourage land use patterns within the urban redevelopment area, which will reduce dependance upon private automobiles for transportation, to encourage high and moderate density development where appropriate, including structured parking, and to promote a diverse mix of dense housing options. In bringing forward this plan amendment. There are a number of legislative findings that council must make. These include that a finding that the 2560 Welton Street Project is located within the 29 BLOCK Welton Corridor Urban Redevelopment Area, and that it will promote the objectives set forth in the Welton Corridor. Urban Redevelopment Plan must find that a feasible method exists for the relocation of displaced individuals and families and business concerns. The project area contains no residences. Therefore no individuals or families will be displaced. Additionally, due to the vacancy of the site, no.\nSpeaker 6: Business concerns will be displaced.\nSpeaker 11: By the project. Finding that written notice of this public hearing has been provided to all property owners, residents and owners.\nSpeaker 4: Of business concerns.\nSpeaker 11: In the resolution setting this public hearing City Council requested Dura to undertake this task. Written notice was mailed first class mail to all known property owners, residents and owners.\nSpeaker 4: Of business concerns.\nSpeaker 11: In the Walton Corridor Urban Redevelopment Area on April 29th.\nSpeaker 4: 2016.\nSpeaker 11: Which is at least 30 days prior to this public hearing. The statute requires that no more than 120 days have passed since the first public hearing before City Council on any plan amendment. Tonight is the first public hearing before Council on this Urban Redevelopment Plan Amendment. The statute also requires that two years must elapse before council consider can consider an urban redevelopment plan amendment if they previously failed to approve that plan amendment. For this project, this is the first consideration by Council of the Urban Redevelopment Plan Amendment for this project. Also, the Plan Amendment contains no property that was included in a previously submitted urban redevelopment plan amendment that was not approved by the City Council. As such, the requirement to wait at least 24 months since any prior prior public hearing is inapplicable. Must find that the plan amendment is in conformance with the Denver Comprehensive Plan. On May 4th, 2016, the Denver Planning Board unanimously found that the proposed amendment to the Walton Corridor Urban Redevelopment Plan conforms to the Denver Comprehensive Plan in applicable supplements. And a letter to the effect has been submitted as part of the record of this hearing and a request. The City Council concur with that finding. The Walton Corridor Urban Redevelopment Plan, as amended by the proposed amendment, will afford maximum opportunity consistent with the sound needs of Denver as a whole for the rehabilitation or redevelopment of the Walton Corridor. Urban Redevelopment Area by Private Enterprise 2560 Walton Street.\nSpeaker 6: LLC.\nSpeaker 11: An affiliate of Palisade Partners, is the property owner and a private development entity who intends to undertake the redevelopment project. Council must also find that the city and county of Denver can adequately finance and agreements are in place to finance any additional city and county of Denver infrastructure and.\nSpeaker 4: Services required to.\nSpeaker 11: Serve development within the 2560 Welton Street Urban Redevelopment Area or project area for the period during which the incremental property taxes are paid to the authority. And the plan allows for cooperative agreements between the city and Doura to be brought forward to address additional infrastructure.\nSpeaker 4: Requirements in city services.\nSpeaker 11: Services should they arise. And finally, this amendment to the Walton Corridor Urban Redevelopment Plan contains provisions for property tax increment financing. The passage of House Bill 15 1348 amended the statute governing urban renewal activities and now requires that before City Council can approve a new urban renewal plan or an amendment to an existing plan, you must find that an agreement has been entered into among the city Dora and the affected taxing district in regards to the allocation of property tax increment to the project. There are two other property taxing districts Denver Public Schools and urban drainage and flood control. As noted earlier, there is a companion ordinance to approve the 2560 Welton Street Cooperation Agreement. This agreement generally directs the responsibilities related to the tax increment. In addition, the cooperation agreement requires DAERA to require the developer to comply with DORA redevelopment programs, including the provision of project art, the first source hiring policy, the utilization of small business enterprises, and the Enhanced Training Opportunities Program. To satisfy the new statutory requirements with respect to the inclusion in the plan of the tax allocation provisions authorized by Section 3125 107 Perin nine of the Colorado Urban Renewal Law, Dura has negotiated agreements with the two taxing entities. This process included.\nSpeaker 4: Noticing the entities.\nSpeaker 11: Of our intention to utilize property tax increment to support the redevelopment project. Following that notification. The taxing entities each evaluated the impact the project would have on their services. Both Denver Public Schools and Urban Drainage and flood control determined that the 2560.\nSpeaker 4: Welton Street.\nSpeaker 11: Project would have minimal service impacts and have each agreed to allow the full available amount of property tax increment generated by their respective maladies to be allocated to the project. Yeah. In closing.\nSpeaker 6: The Denver Urban Renewal Authority is pleased to work with the.\nSpeaker 11: City and county of Denver to bring forward this project. The redevelopment of this site and the delivery of 129 housing units with a combination of market rate and affordable units near downtown and along an existing transit corridor captures many citywide goals, objectives and strategies that are found in the Denver Comprehensive Plan. The Northeast Downtown Neighborhoods Plan and the Walton Corridor Urban Redevelopment Plan. The 2560 Welton Street Project advances many of the Urban Redevelopment Plan objectives which are intended to revitalize this important corridor. And therefore, we ask for your favorable consideration of this amendment, and I'll be happy to answer any questions that you may have.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Tracy. We have two speakers for 322 Paul books and Tracy Winchester.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, council members, for having me back up here. Tracy Winchester. I live at 217 South Jackson Street and Way News District. I am pleased to support 2560 Welton Street because it is everything and embodies everything that we've been trying to do in our revitalization plan. Again, the plan, as outlined by Will Austin, was started in 2009, 2010, 2011, which talked about bringing in new business, bringing in density, bringing in residential. And this incorporates what we want for the area. We had plenty of community meetings again to make sure that everybody was in favor of what this was going to be about, because it is talking about eight stories and this is new for this area. And so we did have some people who commented on that, but we've been zoned since 2010 for eight stories. And this is something that we see is going to be critical for the redevelopment of the area. Thank you.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Tracy.\nSpeaker 7: Thank you, President and council. My name's Paul Brooks with Palisade Partners. And I'm just here to answer any questions you may have. Thank you very much. Thank you.\nSpeaker 2: That concludes our speakers. Time for questions from members of council. Councilman Flynn.\nSpeaker 8: Thanks, Mr. President. Tracy. Just a couple of questions to clarify.\nSpeaker 5: In my mind here. If I can pull up your presentation again.\nSpeaker 1: Mm hmm.\nSpeaker 5: The the tax increment amount is the amount of the principal, if you will. 4.2 million is included in the slide. I'm scrolling down here for the sources and uses, and the $4.2 million tiff reimbursement is listed as a source. Is that needed up front because this is a reimbursable I don't understand. So the developers are going to have to get a bridge or some sort.\nSpeaker 11: Okay. That is correct. Yes. The developer will.\nSpeaker 4: Borrow money.\nSpeaker 11: To pay for those.\nSpeaker 6: Costs that then will be reimbursed through.\nSpeaker 11: The tax.\nSpeaker 5: Increment. And I notice that most of the reimbursements are in the construction phase.\nSpeaker 6: That's correct.\nSpeaker 5: Okay. Thank you. Those are my two questions.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. Councilman Flynn and Councilwoman PANITCH.\nSpeaker 11: Thanks so much. Real quick question for Paul, please. Hi. Thank you again for including some affordable units in here. I think we talked about this in committee, but I'm going to acknowledge my memory is not what it was 6 hours ago. Did you all figure out whether you're going to be able to accept vouchers on at least the 80% of I army units, if not the market rate ones, in terms of just being able to provide just a little bit expanded flexibility for the potential of renters who may bring a voucher with them.\nSpeaker 7: Yes, we started to explore that possibility. And this through our due diligence up to this point, it looks like we should be able to do that. We are actually the next step is to reach out to HUD directly and make make sure that we're not missing anything, but we are exploring that possibility.\nSpeaker 11: Great. Thank you so much. And I think this was mentioned, but just clarify for me, I believe that, again, might have been mentioned. Was there an ID loan in terms of the 80% of my units in this building?\nSpeaker 7: Yes, there is.\nSpeaker 11: Okay. Thank you very much.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Councilwoman and each Councilman Espinosa.\nSpeaker 3: Just a first blush at the rendering and stuff. It genuinely looks like a really thoughtful project and so I'm glad to see us investing in something that seems to consider context and the way forward. But I did want to ask the question, since we just got done with the five points of the discussion, how, what, what elements of the culture district, even though no guidelines or standards exist, what, what makes this sort of of five points, you know, what is what what features.\nSpeaker 9: So yeah, we.\nSpeaker 7: Really started with a strong base and made sure it was masonry, which is very common throughout the district. We also kept with the Chamfered corner a lot of the brick detailing. Another common thing these days are vinyl windows. These are all, Anderson, 100 windows. So they're of a much higher quality. They went down and looked at breaking it up into 100 foot increments at the maximum. So it looked like it was actually if you look at the rendering, it actually has kind of three distinct bases along the bottom. And then we are really excited from a cultural perspective. We are right at the light rail stop and so we actually incorporated a little bit of a more modern element. But the idea is, is, is to have this area that people are very comfortable coming in and trying to have the retail actually flow in somewhat in a mini Union Station concept and then also have the office users that kind of be able to peer down into this space to really create a congregational area to kind of create that vibrancy. So that's just one of or a few of many of our architects down here tonight.\nSpeaker 3: So that's good. Any new space for Councilman Brooks? In my comment, you know, I was noting some of the things that you were talking about. I sort of internalized that that break up of the massing along with that adjoined the light rail station and stuff like that. That's again, the stepping back to the levels and all that other stuff. So yeah, just be so that so far so good. But yeah, if there's some last bit of element placards or sort of terracotta naming or so, I don't know what some sort of detail that sort of again still reinforces where you're at. Please don't, you know, please consider that as well. If you get.\nSpeaker 7: Something, we actually will. The building's been in the Lydian, it's the Lydian mode. After jazz scale, we're really going to honor the jazz heritage at this building and then hopefully the Ionian comes as well next. So but the and then at the Wheatley, which is our project down the way, we were really honoring Phillis Wheatley, the first female African American poet, the why Phillis Wheatley YWCA used to actually sit on that that area. We're actually in the process of creating a digital book and collage. And then and then we've also worked with, you know, part of the DURA requirements is to have public art component and so on that project. And we're probably going to carry it into this project as well. We actually have some exterior cylindrical posts that during the day you can actually read up on the history of the Wheatley on the levee, and it would be about the Lydian. And then at nighttime, intellectually cache some down light in a way that I think we'll will hopefully create in the evening. Kind of a nice energy.\nSpeaker 3: So perfect. That's exactly what I was asking for. So things.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Councilman Espinosa. Councilwoman Ortega.\nSpeaker 4: Crazy. Can you tell me what the how the 80% EMI is spread among the unit mix?\nSpeaker 11: Sure. Um, and if I can.\nSpeaker 4: Pull.\nSpeaker 6: This back. Uh. There we go. So make sure that I'm.\nSpeaker 11: That I'm answering your questions correctly.\nSpeaker 6: So the the.\nSpeaker 11: Lower portion of that slide shows the mix of the 22 affordable units. So four of them will be studios. 16 are one bedroom in two or two bedroom.\nSpeaker 4: Okay, great. Thank you. I I know you covered that, but somehow.\nSpeaker 3: Sure.\nSpeaker 4: All right. Thanks for the question.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. Councilman Ortega. Councilman Brooks. Yeah.\nSpeaker 3: You know, this is I want to I want to bring Paul up to kind of talk about this. And Paul, I know you reached out to Tracy, reached out to myself. One of the requirements so we don't talk a lot about but I will be talking a lot more about we, we, we those projects that are funded by TIFF, we actually have requirements around minority contracting as well. And so just tell us a little bit about what you've done with that and what you're trying some of the numbers you're trying to get to there.\nSpeaker 7: So are in two as part of our you know, part of receiving the financing, we're required to submit an SBA, SBA plan and I believe it is a 23% of our hard costs of the project need to be funded by it. It's it's they've actually changed the requirement recently but women and minority owned businesses. SBA small business may I should have Matt McBride of confluence companies come up because he's the one who manages that entire process and make sure that we're in compliance with all of that. But we've done the same thing on the Wheatley and we're carrying forward obviously on this project.\nSpeaker 3: Yeah. And and just a further comment because I think this is really cool and that a lot of developers have done this. Paul reached out to Tracy, reach out to myself and ask about some of these opportunities, working opportunities for folks of color, you know, on his project. So I thought that was really cool and I think we need to do more of that. We need to. Tracy I'm telling you that we want to see more of that and we want to see that accountability. If we're doing these private kind of projects, he's doing a project in a neighborhood that's tripled the unemployment rate in the city. And so it's important that we're connecting people with jobs. Thanks.\nSpeaker 7: Thank you.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Councilman Brooks. Any other questions? 322 CNN. Public hearing is now closed. Time for comment. Councilman Brooks.\nSpeaker 3: Yep. Thanks, Mr. President. Thanks. Members of council. Thank you to remember the council, who is who who voted in 2012 for the Urban Renewal District. Wow. To see the projects come up is is really exciting that that night many people stood up thinking that eminent domain was the main reason we were, you know, having a conversation. But really, it was about projects like this that fit the scale of the neighborhood, both the built environment scale and the spirit, the scale of the neighborhood. And so I I'm so excited to support this. The thing I want to call out and highlight is I think we celebrate here this passage, but we don't know the frustration and the hard work that goes into this, the meetings of of toiling over the performa to make sure that it's right with Tracy and whoever the developer is. The issues with RTD, because this is on the light rail and and some of the access issues that we have here, the neighbors realizing, oh my goodness, the entitlement is a a zoning of, as you might say. And so all of those issues go in OED trying to figure out how what's the next level of affordability in housing in this. And so you know, Paul, thank you for, you know, fighting the good fight. I hadn't mentioned landmark, my goodness, which is a whole nother deal, but it all came out to be an excellent project. And one of the real mixed use projects, I mean, retail office and housing and different levels of affordability. So we're really excited. And Tracy, thank you so much. Many don't know that Tracy Huggins early on when we first did the urban renewal area said, hey, let's meet every other Friday with some developers, with stakeholders in the community to try to gin up some support. And, you know, I'll never forget those early mornings, like, what are we doing? But they're proven to be fruitful. So thank you. Thank you all for working really hard on this. Thanks.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. Councilman Brooks, you know the comments, 322. CNN. Madam Secretary, welcome.\nSpeaker 4: Black eye. Brooks Clark. Espinosa. Hi.\nSpeaker 13: Flynn I.\nSpeaker 4: Gillmor, I.\nSpeaker 9: Cashman I.\nSpeaker 11: Can hear.\nSpeaker 4: You. Ortega Hi. Sussman, I.

Because the voting announced the results.\nSpeaker 4: 1204.\nSpeaker 2: By 322 is in place on final consideration and do pass. Lastly, Councilman Clark, we need Council Bill three, 23, four and five on the floor for final passage in a block.\nSpeaker 9: Thank you, Mr. President. I move the council bills 323, 324 and 325 be placed upon final consideration and do pass in a block.\nSpeaker 2: It has been moved and seconded. Any comments? Catherine Brooks I'm assuming you don't have comments. I say that? All right. Madam Secretary, roll call.",

The current iteration of the VCF may be unable to pay full benefits to eligible persons and is scheduled to sunset on December 18, 2020. Current VCF data are provided in this report's Appendix . On September 22, 2001, the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act (ATSSA; P.L. 107-42 ) was enacted into law. Quickly passed by Congress in the wake of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, this legislation provided various forms of relief to the American airline industry and affirmed Congress's commitment to improving airline safety. Title IV of the ATSSA also established the VCF to compensate persons injured or the representatives of persons killed in the attacks or their immediate aftermath. The VCF originally closed in 2003 and was reopened in 2011 and expanded to provide compensation to responders to the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and others, such as certain New York City residents, who may have suffered health effects in the aftermath of the attacks. The VCF was reauthorized in 2015 and, if not reauthorized in the 116 th Congress, will sunset on December 18, 2020. The original VCF, as created by Title IV of the ATSSA, provided cash benefits to the following groups of persons who suffered physical injury or death as a result of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001: persons who were present at the World Trade Center, Pentagon, or aircraft crash site in Shanksville, PA, at the time of or in the immediate aftermath of the aircraft crashes at those sites on September 11, 2001; and passengers and crew of any aircraft that crashed on September 11, 2001, as a result of terrorist activity. The amount of benefits available to each claimant was determined by a Special Master appointed by the Attorney General. The amount of benefits payable to each claimant was based on each person's economic losses (such as loss of future earnings) and noneconomic losses (such as pain and suffering). The VCF statute specifically prohibited the payment of punitive damages. Benefits were reduced by certain collateral source payments, such as life insurance benefits, available to the claimant. There was no cap on the amount of benefits that any one person could receive or on total benefits paid. By filing a VCF claim, a person waived his or her right to file a civil action or be a party to such an action in any federal or state court for damages related to the September 11, 2001, terrorist-related aircraft crashes. This provision established the VCF as an alternate and expedited route to compensation for victims while providing some protection against lawsuits for damages that may have been brought by victims against the air carriers; airframe manufacturers; the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, who owned the World Trade Center; or any other entity. Congress provided funding for the VCF through an appropriation of \"such sums as may be necessary\" for benefit payment and administration. The Special Master of the VCF was required to promulgate regulations to govern the program within 90 days of the law's enactment, and all claims had to be filed within two years of the regulations' promulgation, at which time the VCF would close. The original VCF received 7,403 claims and made awards totaling $7.049 billion to 5,560 claimants. The original VCF was closed to new claims in December 2003. However, concerns about injuries and illnesses incurred by persons involved in emergency response, recovery, and debris removal operations at the September 11 th aircraft crash sites led Congress to reopen the VCF with the enactment of Title II of the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act of 2010 (Zadroga Act; P.L. 111-347 ). The reopened VCF extended eligibility for cash benefits to persons who suffered physical injuries or illnesses as a result of rescue, recovery, or debris removal work at or near the September 11 th aircraft crash sites during the period from September 11, 2001, to May 30, 2002, as well as certain persons who lived, worked, or were near the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. The VCF was initially reopened for new claims through October 3, 2016. Total benefits and administrative costs paid by the reopened VCF were limited to $2.775 billion, unlike in the original VCF, which had no cap on total funding for benefits, allowing the Special Master to award benefits without considering the benefits' total cost. Under the reopened VCF, attorneys' fees were limited to 10% of the VCF award. The reopened VCF was scheduled to stop taking claims on October 3, 2016. The VCF was reauthorized on December 18, 2015, with the enactment of Title IV of Division O of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 (Zadroga Reauthorization Act of 2015; P.L. 114-113 ). Under this reauthorization, claims approved before the reauthorization date are considered Group A claims. Group A claims are subject to the same rules as claims under the reopened VCF and are subject to the $2.775 billion cap on total benefit payments. All other claims filed before the final VCF deadline of December 18, 2020, are considered Group B claims subject to additional rules and funding caps established by the reauthorization legislation. Thus, all current claims are Group B claims. To be eligible for VCF benefits, a person must have died as a passenger or crew member on one of the aircraft hijacked on September 11, 2001; died as a direct result of the terrorist-related aircraft crashes or rescue, recovery, or debris removal in the immediate aftermath of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks; or been present at a September 11 th crash site in the immediate aftermath of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and suffered physical harm as a direct result of the crashes or the rescue, recovery, and debris removal efforts. For the purposes of VCF eligibility, the immediate aftermath of the September 11 th terrorist attacks is the time period from September 11, 2001, to May 30, 2002. For the purposes of VCF eligibility, the September 11 th crash sites include the World Trade Center, Pentagon, or Shanksville, PA, crash sites; the buildings or portions of buildings that were destroyed as a result of the September 11 th terrorist attacks; the area in Manhattan that is south of the line that runs along Canal Street from the Hudson River to the intersection of Canal Street and East Broadway, north on East Broadway to Clinton Street, and east on Clinton Street to the East River; and any area related to debris removal, such as the debris-removal barges and Fresh Kills in Staten Island, New York. To be eligible for the VCF, individuals who did not die as passengers or crew members of one of the hijacked aircraft, or as a direct result of the September 11 th terrorist attacks (including rescue, recovery, and debris removal), must have suffered physical harm as a result of the attacks. For the purposes of VCF eligibility, physical harm is demonstrated by the presence of a World Trade Center (WTC)-related physical health condition as defined for the purposes of the World Trade Center Health Program (WTCHP). A WTC-related physical health condition is a physical health condition covered by the WTCHP. These conditions are those provided in statute at Sections 3312(a) and 3322(b) of the Public Health Service Act (PHSA) and those added through rulemaking by the WTCHP administrator. Per Section 3312(a) of the PHSA, to be covered by the WTCHP and thus compensable under the VCF, a condition must be on the list of covered WTCHP-covered conditions and it must be determined that exposure in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks \"is substantially likely to be a significant factor in aggravating, contributing to, or causing the illness or health condition.\" In most cases, the VCF requires that a person's condition be certified by the WTCHP for that condition to be compensable. The WTCHP provides guidance on how to evaluate if a person's condition meets the standard to be linked to exposure in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. This evaluation is based on a combination of the amount of time a person was physically present at a site and the specific activities\u00e2\u0080\u0094such as search and rescue, sleeping in a home in Lower Manhattan, or just passing through a site\u00e2\u0080\u0094in which the person engaged. For example, a person who was engaged in search and rescue activities at the World Trade Center site between September 11 and September 14, 2001, must have been present for at least 4 hours for the WTCHP to certify his or her condition and thus compensable by the VCF, whereas a person whose only activity was passing through Lower Manhattan during the same period, and who was not caught in the actual dust cloud resulting from the buildings' collapse, would have to have been in the area for at least 20 hours to be eligible for compensation. The WTCHP evaluates conditions that do not meet the minimum exposure criteria on a case-by-case basis using \"professional judgement\" and \"any relevant medical and/or scientific information.\" WTCHP-covered mental health conditions may not be used to establish VCF eligibility, as the VCF does not include any provisions for benefit payments for mental health conditions. The WTCHP statute does not include any type of cancer in the list of WTC-related health conditions. However, the statute does require the WTCHP administrator to periodically review the available scientific evidence to determine if any type of cancer should be covered by the WTCHP and, by extension, the VCF. In response to a petition to add conditions to the list of WTC-related health conditions, the WTCHP administrator is required, within 90 days, to either request a recommendation on action from the WTC Scientific/Technical Advisory Committee (STAC) or make a determination on adding the health condition. If the WTCHP administrator requests a recommendation from the STAC, that recommendation must be made within 90 days of its receipt and the WTCHP administrator must act on that request within an additional 90 days. On September 7, 2011, Representatives Carolyn B. Maloney, Jerrold Nadler, Peter King, Charles B. Rangel, Nydia M. Velazquez, Michael G. Grimm, and Yvette Clarke and Senators Charles E. Schumer and Kirsten E. Gillibrand filed a petition, in the form of a letter to the WTCHP administrator, requesting that the administrator \"conduct an immediate review of new medical evidence showing increased cancer rates among firefighters who served at ground zero\" and that the administrator \"consider adding coverage for cancer under the Zadroga Act.\" In response to this petition, the WTC administrator requested that the STAC \"review the available information on cancer outcomes associated with the exposures resulting from the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, and provide advice on whether to add cancer, or a certain type of cancer, to the List specified in the Zadroga Act.\" On September 12, 2012, based on the STAC's recommendations, the WTCHP administrator added more than 60 types of cancer, covering nearly every body system and including any cancers in persons less than 20 years of age and any rare cancers, to the list of WTC-related health conditions, thus making these conditions compensable under the VCF. In a review of the decision to add cancers to the list of WTC-related health conditions, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that the WTCHP administrator used a hazards-based approach to evaluate cancers. This approach evaluated whether exposures in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks were associated with types of cancer but did not evaluate the probability of developing cancer based on a given exposure. A GAO-convened scientific panel indicated that the hazards-based approach the WTCHP administrator used was reasonable given data constraints and the fact that there is a certification process to determine if a cancer or other condition on the list of WTC-related health conditions meets the statutory requirement of being \"substantially likely to be a significant factor in aggravating, contributing to, or causing the illness or health condition.\" The panel also indicated that this approach could have benefited from an independent peer review process. The WTCHP administrator stated that peer review was not possible given the statutory time constraints to act on the petition and the STAC's recommendation. One year later, the WTCHP administrator added prostate cancer to the list of WTC-related health conditions. The WTCHP administrator has also established minimum latency periods for certain types of cancer and maximum onset periods for certain types of aerodigestive disorders. The Civil Division of the Department of Justice administers the VCF. The VCF Special Master, currently Rupa Bhattacharyya decides VCF eligibility and benefits. A claimant dissatisfied with the Special Master's decision on his or her claim may file an appeal and request a hearing before a VCF hearing officer appointed by the VCF. There is no further right of appeal or judicial review of VCF decisions. A claimant may amend his or her claim after a decision has been made if the claimant has new material relevant to the claim. All claims for VCF benefits must be filed by December 18, 2020, five years after the VCF reauthorization act's enactment. Before filing a claim, a potential claimant must have registered with the VCF by one of the following applicable deadlines: by October 3, 2013, if the claimant knew, or reasonably should have known, that he or she suffered a physical harm or died as a result of the September 11 th attacks or rescue, recovery, or debris removal efforts, and that he or she was eligible for the VCF, on or before October 3, 2011; within two years of the date the claimant knew, or reasonably should have known, that he or she has a WTC-related physical health condition or died as a result of the September 11 th attacks and is eligible for the VCF. If a claimant has a condition that is later added to the list of conditions covered by the WTCHP, then the two-year period begins on the later of the dates when a government entity, such as the WTCHP or a state workers' compensation agency, determines that the condition is related to the September 11 th attacks, or when a claimant's condition is added to the list of conditions covered by the WTCHP. Benefits under the original VCF were not subject to any caps on individual or total payments. When the VCF was reopened, total benefits were subject to a cap of $2.775 billion; however, there were no specific caps on individual benefits. VCF benefits for Group B are subject to caps on noneconomic losses and total benefits. Benefits under the VCF for Group B claims are determined by the Special Master based on the claimant's economic and noneconomic losses. For noneconomic losses, there is a cap of $250,000 for claims based on cancer and $90,000 for all other claims. However, for cases in which a person's death was caused by a WTC-related health condition, the VCF regulations provide that the presumed award for noneconomic loss is $250,000 plus an additional $100,000 for the person's spouse and each dependent. When calculating economic losses, the Special Master is only permitted to consider the first $200,000 in annual income when determining losses to past earnings and future earning capacity, which limits the amount of economic losses that can be paid. There is a total cap of $4.6 billion for VCF Group B awards. As in past iterations of the VCF, benefits are reduced by certain collateral source payments available to claimants, such as life insurance benefits, workers' compensation payments, and government benefits related to the person's injury or death, such as Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) and the Public Safety Officers' Benefits Program (PSOB). The costs of VCF benefits and administration are not subject to annual appropriations. Rather, costs for Group A benefits and administration were financed by the $2.775 billion in appropriations provided by the Zadroga Act. Costs for Group B benefits and administration are financed by the one-time appropriation of $4.6 billion provided in the Zadroga Reauthorization Act of 2015. Thus, the total funding available for the VCF since its reopening is $7.375 billion. Funding was made exempt from budget sequestration by the Zadroga Reauthorization Act of 2015. Total funding for VCF benefits and administrative costs is capped by the $7.375 billion in appropriations that have been provided in the Zadroga Act and Zadroga Reauthorization Act of 2015, with a total cap of $4.6 billion for VCF Group B awards. The VCF statute requires the Special Master to annually reassess VCF policies and procedures to determine if these policies and procedures satisfy the statutory requirements that claimants with the most debilitating physical conditions have their claims prioritized and that total expenditures for awards and administrative costs associated with Group B claims do not exceed the $4.6 billion in available funding. In October 2018, the Special Master published a Notice of Inquiry in the Federal Register seeking public comments on possible policy changes that the Special Master could consider to ensure there is sufficient funding to administer and pay future VCF claims without exceeding the $4.6 billion cap on Group B expenditures. The Special Master received 28 comments in response to this Notice of Inquiry, of which 16 were relevant to the request for information on possible VCF policy and procedure changes. In February 2019, the Special Master published her most recent annual assessment of VCF policies and procedures. This report includes two sets of projections of future VCF benefit and administrative costs. One projection is based on historical program data and another projection is based on these historical data, augmented by data on recent program trends. These two models were also used in the 2017 assessment, whereas the 2018 assessment only projected costs based on historical program data. As shown in Table 1 , the Special Master projects under both models that total VCF program costs by the end of the program will far exceed the $7.375 billion in available funding. This is the first time the Special Master projects that program funding will be insufficient to pay all VCF benefits and administrative expenses. On June 21, 2019, during testimony before the House Committee on the Judiciary, the Special Master pointed to increases in death claims, cancer claims, and claims from non-responders have played a role in driving projected benefit costs above the amount of available funding Congress provided. The Special Master did not, however, break down how much of the cost increases can be attributed to each of these three factors. As of May 31, 2019, the Special Master has determined that 1,057 death claims are eligible for the reopened VCF. Of these, award decisions based on economic and noneconomic loss have been made in 856 cases. As a comparison, the original VCF paid awards in 2,880 cases of death. Because there is a regulatory presumption of noneconomic loss of $250,000 for the decedent and an additional $100,000 for the spouse and any dependents, noneconomic loss awards in death cases have the potential to be larger than those in injury cases. Since the VCF's reauthorization in 2015, the number of eligible and awarded death cases has increased significantly. For claims paid prior to reauthorization (Group A claims), awards were paid in 17 death cases. Thus, in less than four years since reauthorization, there has been a nearly 5,000% increase in death awards. Of the 839 death awards paid since reauthorization, 517 were awarded in the period between April 30, 2018, and April 30, 2019, with an additional 43 claims paid in May 2019. Through the end of May 2019, there has been an average of more than 35 new eligibility decisions and more than 48 new awards in death claims per month. Although the Special Master does not discuss the causes of the increases in death claims, the nature of many of the compensable medical conditions, especially certain types of cancer with low survival rates, means that many persons eligible for compensation from the VCF will likely die as a result of their WTC-related health conditions, thus possibly making their families eligible for death compensation. Cancers were first added to the VCF as compensable conditions in September 2012. Since then, there have been 8,734 cases with at least one form of cancer determined to be eligible for the VCF. As of the end of April 2019, eligible claims with at least one type of cancer made up 37% of all eligible VCF claims. As shown in Table 2 , the most significant growth in cancer claims occurred shortly after cancers were added to the list of WTC-eligible health conditions and also in the most recent year. Between September 30, 2014, and December 31, 2015, the number of eligible claims with cancer as the only compensable condition (cases that would not otherwise be eligible for the VCF if not for the addition of cancer) increased 194% from 472 claims to 1,387 claims. This increase is understandable and expected given that this was early in the period during which cancer claims were first eligible for compensation. However, the recent increase in eligible cancer-only claims as a percentage of all eligible claims is one of the factors that drove the projected program costs, which were just below total available funds in the 2018 assessment, over the funding cap in the 2019 assessment. In 2018, the number of eligible cancer-only claims increased 58%. At the end of 2018, eligible cancer-only claims made up 18% of all eligible claims. The increase in eligible cancer claims is notable for three reasons. First, no types of cancer were compensable when the VCF was originally reopened in 2010 and no cancers were included in the list of WTC-related health conditions created by Congress in the Zadroga Act. Cancers were added to the list of covered conditions by the WTCHP administrator in two determinations made in 2012 and 2013. These determinations resulted in more than 60 types of cancer covering nearly every body system being compensable under the VCF. Neither the VCF nor WTCHP statutes include any specific provisions requiring any follow-up or continuous review of scientific evidence to determine if, in the nearly seven years since these determinations were made, there is any additional evidence to support or refute including these types of cancers in the list of WTC-related health conditions compensable under the VCF. The GAO cited limitations on data available in 2012 as a reason that its scientific panel found the WTCHP administrator's use of a hazards-based rather than probability model to add cancers to the list of WTC-related health conditions reasonable. Given the increases in the number of persons receiving services from the WTCHP and developing cancer in the years since the 2012 and 2013 cancer determinations, there may be additional data to warrant reevaluating the list of covered cancers or evaluating the likelihood of developing cancer after different types of exposures in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. In addition, the VCF covers a wide range of persons from firefighters and police officers who were the first responders to the attacks, to construction and other workers who were involved in debris removal, and to adults and children who were in lower Manhattan at the time of the attacks, all of whom may have had different types and durations of exposure to toxic substances in the aftermath of the attacks. Although the determination that a person's health condition was linked to his or her exposure in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks is based on a combination of duration and nature of exposure, the list of covered conditions, including all cancers except childhood cancer, applies equally to all persons with no accounting for individual exposure experience. Second, the VCF is a program of presumptive eligibility. Thus, when determining eligibility for the VCF, controlling factors such as genetics, age, behaviors such as tobacco use, or exposure to other toxins are not considered and the Special Master does not make a determination as to the probability that a person's exposure in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks caused his or her cancer. Rather, the only requirement that a cancer or other health condition be linked to a person's exposure in the aftermath of the attacks is the WTCHP's determination that such exposure \"is substantially likely to be a significant factor in aggravating, contributing to, or causing the illness or health condition.\" In addition, the WTCHP administrator did not consider the likelihood or probability that any given cancer would occur based on the hazards experienced in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, attacks when cancers were added to list of WTC-related health conditions. This approach is different than the probability of causation model used for some cancer claims under Part B of the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act (EEOICPA), in which the probability that a person's cancer was caused by occupational exposure to ionizing radiation must be 50% or greater to receive compensation. The VCF's presumptive eligibility model is also in contrast to the probability of causation model recommended by the National Research Council Board on Radiation Effects Research to be used to determine eligibility for benefits under the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA) for persons who lived near the Nevada Test Site during atmospheric atomic weapons testing. However, the presumptive eligibility model is used for other federal compensation programs, including disability compensation for veterans exposed to radiation and Agent Orange. Third, cancer claims have the potential to result in higher benefits than non-cancer claims. The cap on noneconomic loss awards for cancer claims is $250,000 versus $90,000 for non-cancer claims. Since it was reauthorized in 2015, the VCF has paid awards to an increasing number of non-responders. For claims paid prior to reauthorization (Group A claims), awards to non-responders\u00e2\u0080\u0094including those who participated in cleaning or maintenance work near one of the crash sites or persons who lived in, worked in, attended school in, or were visiting lower Manhattan between September 11, 2001, and May 30, 2002\u00e2\u0080\u0094made up 14% of total initial compensation awards. As of the end of 2018, the percentage of total awards made to non-responders had risen to 19% of total initial awards. Although the Special Master cites the increase in non-responder claims as one of the causes of the increase in VCF benefit costs and the recent projection that program costs will exceed available funding, limitations in the data reported by the VCF make analyzing this potential cost driver difficult. In her congressional testimony, the Special Master states \"At the time of Reauthorization in December 2015, not quite 14% of all VCF awards were paid to non-responders. Today, just about 38% of claims filed are from this population.\" However, this is not a direct comparison, as the Special Master is comparing data on awards with data on claims filed, regardless of whether those claims result in awards without any additional information on the percentage of claims filed that may result in awards. In addition, the data reported by the VCF in its annual status reports are, according to the VCF, self-reported data. Finally, in each year's data on claimant categories, there are a number of cases listed as \"no response.\" Of the 20,981 initial awards reported in the VCF's most recent status report, for example, 370 cases, or 2% of total awards, are listed in the \"no response\" category. Because award costs under both models are projected to exceed the $7.375 billion in available funding, in February 2019, the Special Master announced the following reductions in the amounts of all future VCF awards for all cases pending as of February 25, 2019: For all cases filed on or before February 1, 2019; the calculated award is to be reduced by 50%; For all cases that qualify for expedited processing because the claimant has a terminal illness or significant financial hardship, the calculated award is to be reduced by 50%; and For all cases filed after February 1, 2019, the calculated award is to be reduced by 70%. In all cases, the full amount of any offsets for collateral source payments are to continue to be taken. The award reductions are not to apply to appeals decisions initially issued before February 25, 2019. However, there will be scheduling adjustments for future appeals. For appeals of noneconomic loss decisions, the VCF is to schedule appeals hearings only for cases involving the most severe conditions, such as cancer, interstitial lung disease, and sarcoidosis. For all other noneconomic loss and economic-loss cases, the VCF is not to schedule appeals hearings until after December 18, 2020. These schedule changes are designed to ensure that there is sufficient funding to pay increased noneconomic loss determinations made on appeal for the most severe conditions. The VCF is scheduled to sunset on December 18, 2020. The 116 th Congress faces the question of whether to reauthorize the program or let it expire. On June 12, 2019, the House Committee on the Judiciary ordered that H.R. 1327 , the Never Forget the Heroes: Permanent Authorization of the September 11 th Victim Compensation Fund Act, be reported. Identical legislation, S. 546 , is pending committee action in the Senate. This reauthorization legislation includes the following major components: authorization for the VCF through FY2090, with a deadline of October 1, 2089, to file claims; removal of the cap on VCF funding; appropriations of \"such sums as may be necessary\" for the VCF for each fiscal year through FY2090; payment of the difference between the full award and the actual amount received for all persons who received reduced awards due to the Special Master's actions; authority for the Special Master to exceed the limit on noneconomic loss if it is determined that a person's pain and suffering is of such severity as to make the award \"insufficiently compensatory\"; and a cost of living adjustment, to be made every five years, to the maximum amount of annual income permitted to be considered by the Special Master when determining economic loss (currently $200,000). The reauthorization legislation would not make any changes to the basic eligibility for VCF awards. The legislation also would not specifically address the three drivers of increased VCF costs that the Special Master identified in her 2019 congressional testimony: (1) increases in death claims, (2) cancer claims, and (3) claims from non-responders. However, because this legislation would provide full funding for the VCF not subject to annual appropriations, any increases in program costs would not result in the VCF having insufficient funding to pay all benefits. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that this legislation, if enacted, would result in $6.785 billion in direct spending on benefits and administration between FY2019 and FY2024 and $10.180 billion in spending between FY2019 and FY2029. On July 12, 2019, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 1327 with the following amendments: the bill's title was changed to the \"Never Forget the Heroes: James Zadroga, Ray Pfeifer, and Luis Alvarez Permanent Authorization of the September 11 th Victim Compensation Fund Act\"; the appropriations of \"such sums as may be necessary\" for the VCF for each fiscal year through FY2090 is changed to include each fiscal year through FY2092, and the deadline for filing claims is changed from October 1, 2089, to October 1, 2090; the authority for the Special Master to exceed the limit on noneconomic loss is changed from requiring a determination that a person's pain and suffering is of such severity as to make the award \"insufficiently compensatory\" to a determination that the claim \"presents special circumstances\"; the original bill's requirement that the Special Master apply a cost-of-living adjustment to the maximum amount of annual income permitted to be considered when determining economic loss (currently $200,000) every five years was replaced with a provision requiring the Special Master to \"periodically\" adjust the limit \"to account for inflation\"; a provision was added permitting the Attorney General to appoint up to two Deputy Special Masters and providing that the Special Master and the deputies serve at the pleasure of the Attorney General; and a provision was added specifying that the legislation's budgetary effects shall not be entered on the statutory or Senate PAYGO scorecards, thus making the legislation exempt from PAYGO requirements that new legislative spending not increase the deficit.",

Congress created the original VCF shortly after the 2001 terrorist attacks to provide compensation to persons injured and to the families of persons killed in the attacks and their immediate aftermath. In 2011, Congress reopened the VCF to provide benefits to persons who responded to the terrorist attack sites, were involved in the cleanup of these sites, or lived in lower Manhattan during the attacks. The VCF was reauthorized in 2015, and it is scheduled to sunset on December 18, 2020. The VCF has awarded more than $5 billion since its reopening and is in danger of exceeding its current appropriation of $7.375 billion before its sunset date and thus being unable to pay full benefits. In February 2019, the Special Master of the VCF announced that all future VCF awards would be reduced to prevent the VCF from running out of appropriated funds. The Special Master cites increases in death claims, cancer claims, and claims from non-responders as drivers of the increase in VCF benefit costs. Reauthorization bills, H.R. 1327 and S. 546 , have been introduced, with H.R. 1327 being ordered reported out of the Judiciary Committee on June 12, 2019. Both bills would reauthorize the VCF without changing any eligibility categories and appropriate \"such sums as may be necessary\" for each fiscal year through FY2090. On July 12, 2019, H.R. 1327 was passed by the House of Representatives with amendments that changed the bill's name, changed the provisions for adjusting the maximum amount of income considered for determining noneconomic loss, added up to two Deputy Special Masters to the program's administration, and made the bill's spending exempt from PAYGO requirements.",

contagious disease that implies an imbalance of normal molecular interactions between the tooth surface / subsurface and the adjacent bacterial biofilm thus , antimicrobial mouth rinses that augment daily home care may provide an efficient income of remove or controlling bacterial plaque to limit gingivitis and periodontitis . here is a continuous need of new antimicrobial components due to rapid appearance of multiple drug - resistance bacteria . the genus juglans ( family juglandaceae ) comprises several species and is widely dispersed throughout the world . many parts of green walnuts such as shells , kernel and seed , bark , and leaves are used in the pharmaceutical and beauty industry [ 6 , 7 ] . juglans regia l. bark is used in some countries as a toothbrush and as a dye for coloring the lips for makeup purpose . walnut ( juglans regia l. ) bark has been claimed to own anti - inflammatory , blood purify , anticancer , depurative , diuretic , and laxative activities . juglans regia stem bark contains chemical constituents , namely , -sitosterol , ascorbic acid5 , juglone , folic acid , gallic acid , regiolone , and quercetin-3--l - arabinoside [ 10 , 11 ] . antifungal , antibacterial , and antioxidant activities of this plant have been described [ 1216 ] . its extract of juglans regia bark showed a broad spectrum antimicrobial activity in a dose - dependent manner . it inhibited the growth of several pathogenic microorganisms such as gram - positive bacteria ( staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus mutans ) , gram - negative bacteria ( escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa ) , and pathogenic yeast ( candida albicans ) . the extract has either synergistic or additive act when tested with a broad variety of antibacterial drugs . rahul tested the stem bark extracts of j. regia l. for antimicrobial activity against the microbes present in the saliva specimens of patients suffering from dental caries . acetone extract was found to be more effective of the extracts as antimicrobial against the oral microflora . since many of currently used natural products are either detrimental or ineffective , natural folk medicines with antimicrobial effects have been under investigation during the few past decades . growing emphasis of plant studies in the field of dentistry is due to the antibiotic - resistant bacteria , side effects of chemical antibiotics , and their high cost in developing countries . juglans regia bark species have been analyzed chemically adequately in several studies , and in agreement among most of them , with respect to the essential oil composition , the major components are phenolic compounds , terpenoids , alkaloids , flavonoids , and steroids . it is reported that leaves from j. regia l. contain monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes , and the bark contains ketones like juglone , regiolone , sterol , and flavonoid . juglans regia bark is a medicinal plant used in iranian folk medicine as antimicrobial medicine [ 19 , 20 ] . the aim of the present study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activities of ethanolic and aqueous extracts of juglans regia bark against four species of oral bacteria . the plant material ( stem bark ) of the species was collected from local market from kordestan , iran , and confirmed at department of botany , school of agriculture , shahid chamran university , ahvaz , iran . juglans regia bark powdered ( 100  g ) was extracted by 500  ml of ethanol ( for preparing the ethanolic extract ) and 500  cc of water ( for preparing the aqueous one ) consecutively using soxhlet extractor with not exceeding the boiling point of the solvent . the extracts were filtered by whatman filter paper and then concentrated in vacuum at 40c by means of a rotary evaporator . the bacteria strains were used for antibiogram pattern including streptococcus mutans ptcc1683 , streptococcus salivarius ptcc1448 , streptococcus sanguis ptcc1449 , and staphylococcus aureus ptcc : 1112 , were provided by the iranian microbial type culture collection . the strains were inoculated in blood agar and incubated at 37c at least for 24  h , until emergent adequate colonies . the bacteria strains were touching to 4 - 5 colonies raised from pure microorganism culture and inoculated at the concentration in order to attain the mc . farland no : 0.5 density and then streptococci species and staphylococcus aureus incubated in muller - hinton and blood agar , respectively . extracts were diluted in water , and thus 1  gr of each extract inoculated in 1  ml distil water and diluted it to obtain different concentrations as 1000 , 500 , 250 , 125 , and 62.5  mg / ml for aqueous and ethanolic extracts . the blank discs ( padtan teb co , iran ) were inoculated with 20  l of every concentration extracts and placed on the muller - hinton and blood agar were cultivated with bacterial strains . negative controls used the same solvents to dissolve the extracts , and tetracycline ( 30  g ) and erythromycin ( 15  g ) were used as positive references . antimicrobial pattern was evaluated by measuring the zone of inhibition against the test bacteria based on millimeters . the mic values were read as the antibacterial concentration at the point where dense colonial growth intersected the disc [ 22 , 23 ] . analysis of variance ( anova ) was used to determine the significance ( p  0.05 ) of the data obtained in all tests . the inhibition zones due to aqueous extract , negative control ( water ) , and positive control ( tetracycline 30  g , erythromycine 15  g ) are showed in table 1 . aqueous extract had significantly antibacterial effect against staphylococcus aureus , s. salivarius ( figure 2 ) , and s. sanguis ( figure 4 ) compared to control and was significant ( p < 0.0001 ) , but it did not show effect on s. mutans when compared with erythromycin . also the results were shown that ethanolic extracts were significant ( p < 0.0001 ) with inhibitory effect on the growth of four tested bacteria , in contrast to negative control ( table 2 ) . the mic was evaluated for the antimicrobial activity of ethanolic and aqueous extracts of juglans regia on bacteria and the results were shown in table 3 . according to the obtained mic values , ethanol extract of juglans regia bark had the lowest mic of 1.25  microg / ml on s. sanguis ( figure 3 ) . ethanol extract mic value for s. salivarius ( figure 1 ) and aqueous extract mic value for s. sanguis and s. salivarius were similar , 2.50  microg / ml . antibacterial activity of the aqueous extract on staphylococcus aureus was the least sensitivity with a highest determined mic of 125  microg / ml , while mic value for the ethanolic extract was 2.00  microg / ml . aqueous extract did not have any inhibitory effect on s. mutans in terms of antimicrobial activity ; however , for the ethanol extract it was 5.00  microg / ml . the most important cause of gingival inflammation and dental caries is bacterial plaque . some of people keep away from chemical mouth rinse because of the presence of alcohol , artificial preservation , or artificial color in mouth rinses the present study showed that juglans regia are potential antimicrobial agents and can be used in oral hygiene products .   according to our finding , we indicated that the high concentrations of ethanolic and aqueous extracts have had antimicrobial effects against s. sanguis , s. mutans , s. salivarius , and staphylococcus aureus with significant difference in contrast to control . we indicated that ethanolic extract exhibited zones of inhibition against all the tested samples , whereas aqueous extract is active with comparatively smaller zones of inhibition ( tables 1 and 2 ) . reported that the acetone extract of j. regia l was found to be more effective of the extracts as antimicrobial against the oral microflora . . showed that walnut leaves could be used as an easily available source of natural compounds to inhibit the growth of different gram - positive bacteria responsible for dental plaques and oral hygiene problems . recently , darmani et al . reported the growth inhibition of various cariogenic bacteria ( streptococcus mutans , streptococcus salivarius , lactobacillus casei , and actinomyces viscosus ) by walnut aqueous extract . the data of this study clearly indicated that ethanolic and aqueous extracts of juglans regia bark significantly inhibited the growth of the tested oral bacteria , and those reports are compatible with our finding . the antibacterial property of the plant material may be due to the presence of phenolic compounds , terpenoid , alkaloids , flavonoids , and steroids . this study has confirmed the antimicrobial potentials of this kind of iranian plant , thus supporting its folklore application as a preventive remedy for various microbial diseases ( caries and periodontal disease ) in the oral cavity in iran . it provides the basis for the present rapidly increasing interest for the use of natural antioxidants and antimicrobials . further studies are required to find these effects in order to replace synthetic medications with natural remedies . we concluded that iranian bark of juglone , regiolane , has the antibacterial effects against the important oral bacteria , and ethanolic extract was of higher effectivity against tested bacteria than aqueous extract .",

    "document": "Speaker 1: Considered directing staff to provide the city council with a report on the feasibility of including Alameda in the service area or the Bay Area Bike Share Program. This referral came from Councilmember Ody and Brody.\nSpeaker 5: Thank you for being at such a late hour. I'll try to be brief so we can get out of here. So just as a little bit of background, MTC, the Metropolitan Transportation Commission recently contracted with a company to operate the bike share program and expanded from 700 bicycles to 7000 bicycles are doing this in Oakland, San Francisco , San Jose, Emeryville and Berkeley. Unfortunately, Alameda is not part of that. I know the MBC was looking to expand it to other cities and I would just like to get the sense of the council to instruct staff that if MTC is still looking to expand this or if they're looking to expand this in the future, you know that Alameda make an effort to participate because I think we really are of all of the cities in the Bay Area the most bikeable and you know bike sharing for those that don't know it like city car share where you can pick up a car, you know, take it somewhere and drop it off. Same thing with bike sharing and get on a bike. I think somebody even mentioned it not at the last meeting, but in the previous meeting. You know, that they can just hop on a bike, you know, ride over to Alameda Point, drop it off, you know, pick up another one later. So I know it's not like the biggest issue facing the council today and this month, but I think it's something that, you know, given our our geography and our topography as being flat and the way all of Alameda loves biking and reducing car emissions, that is something that we consider being a part of in the future.\nSpeaker 0: Member Ashcraft.\nSpeaker 4: I'm a big fan of city bike share programs. When I visit my kids in Washington, D.C., I pack my helmet and I use the city bike share there, and it's really reasonably priced. And I would also love to see allow me to be a part of it. I wondered if this is something we wanted to present to the Transportation Commission, to perhaps even study and put together a proposal for MTC just because they handle those sorts of things. And but I certainly agree with Councilmember Ody that we are a flat city. We've got the topography, we are adding more bike lanes all the time. And we constantly are trying to get people out of their cars and onto alternate means of transportation, both to reduce our traffic, to improve their health and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which is our responsibility as elected leaders. But I'm just wondering whether this might appropriately reside with the Transportation Commission.\nSpeaker 3: So I think any anything that we do on this matter would clearly end up not end up there, but find their way there and then on to the council. So we would be absolutely sure to include the Transportation Commission on anything we do on this.\nSpeaker 0: Though, could staff look at and so I don't know how MTC arrived at what cities or if cities had to pay any moneys to participate, could start, look into it and then just maybe report back to us or how would staff propose we go forward on the site and.\nSpeaker 3: We would definitely want to take a look at how they identified the cities. And also, was there a cost to participating? And if there was, how much and do we think that we could you know, obviously, if there's some monetary implication, we would want to talk to the council about that, too. So we'll bring it back in and take a look at, you know, we need to analyze the program and how they identified the cities.\nSpeaker 0: And I want to thank member Ody for bringing this to him as a referral. I think that's a great idea.\nSpeaker 5: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Member de SAC.\nSpeaker 6: Yes, I think we should certainly take a look at this and as part of the review of it, also make sure to involve outfits that at this point in time rent out bikes in Alameda, of which there might be several. Particularly one on an offshore onshore island drive near the McDonald's restaurant. So I'm sure it's not an either or situation, but if we just make sure that we work it in, you know, everyone can turn out a winner.\nSpeaker 5: And Rudy in the staff report. You know, there were a lot of different, you know, issues like, for example, not taking away parking meters, space, things like that. So a lot of this has to be evaluated. But it would be nice if Alameda. Yeah. Could be at least at the table and and be one of the possible future sites for this.\nSpeaker 0: That concludes that item in. Yes. You're good. All right. We're going to move on then.\nSpeaker 6: I mean.\nSpeaker 0: You had direction with that.\nSpeaker 4: There's consensus.",

    "document": "ensuring the highest quality of health care for all stroke patients is important in the current climate of scarce resources and the increasing burden of stroke to the health sector . there is a strong international momentum to improve the quality of acute stroke management.1 this is supported by high level evidence that now underpins many acute stroke interventions , including several provided by allied health professionals.2 although much of the current research on quality in stroke care has focused on factors that may influence medical interventions,37 allied health professionals are similarly interested in ways to implement best practice care.8 allied health professionals are members of multidisciplinary stroke teams and contribute to patient care from early in acute admission , through the stroke rehabilitation phase , and beyond . the professional composition of acute stroke teams may vary internationally . in the australian context of this study , allied health members include physiotherapists , occupational therapists , speech pathologists , social workers , dietitians , and psychologists.2 several researchers suggest that patient age is a determinant of the quality of medical and allied health care patients receive following acute stroke.35,913 we have previously reported that age and gender , on their own , are not related to an overall index of allied health care quality.14 further investigation is now required to determine whether patient age and gender are associated with individual measures of allied health care , and further , whether other variables , such as comorbidity , prestroke independence , and stroke severity , are putatively associated with allied health care . if there are differences in allied health care provided to patients with acute stroke , it is important to understand why care might differ , so that quality improvement strategies can be effectively targeted at problem areas . this paper explores demographic and stroke - related factors ( predictor variables ) , including patient age , which may be associated with individual measures of quality of care provided to acute stroke patients by allied health professionals . our aim was to provide systematically determined information to guide clinical quality audits and targeted quality improvement strategies in stroke care . ethical considerations and our sampling framework have been reported in detail previously.14 in summary , we conducted a retrospective clinical audit of medical records for 300 acute stroke patients from three metropolitan tertiary hospitals in adelaide , south australia , australia . sampled patients had been consecutively admitted to hospital prior to august 2009 , and the audit was conducted between november 2009 and april 2010 . we previously reported on an overall index of 20 performance indicators of allied health service quality , identified from a literature review ( listed in table 2).14,15 although several of these indicators relate to interdisciplinary elements of stroke care which may be shared within a stroke team , the focus of this study is the ability of allied health professionals to contribute to this work , because this is largely unexplored . in our earlier study , quality of care was determined by per patient compliance with all 20 process indicators.14 in the current study phase , compliance with each process indicator was considered individually and associations were explored with predictor variables . allied health professionals of interest in our research were from physiotherapy , occupational therapy , speech pathology , dietetics , social work , and psychology . previous clinical audits and literature reviews of stroke provided awareness of the demographic and clinical variables that could be extracted retrospectively from medical records.1315 these variables are captured by stroke clinicians to assist diagnosis and clinical management , or for service monitoring . data were extracted from medical records on patient age , gender , premorbid levels of independence and accommodation type , english proficiency , comorbidity levels , weekend or weekday admission , stroke unit admission , initial stroke severity , length of stay in the acute hospital , and process indicator compliance . many of these demographic and clinical variables have been associated with care quality in the stroke literature , especially for medical care,14 or as predictors of stroke outcomes . however , none of these predictor variables have previously been well explored for their influence on stroke care by allied health professionals . in addition to the evidence discussed above regarding age - related differences in care , researchers have reported associations between gender and stroke care quality.1618 stroke severity is strongly linked to survival and discharge destination outcomes,19,20 and a priori reasoning suggests that it may prompt allied health care processes , such as swallow assessment , in patients with obvious risks of poor outcome . stroke severity may also influence the ease with which specific care , such as early rehabilitation , can be achieved . admission over a weekend has previously been reported to influence care standards and patient outcomes following acute stroke.12,21 the scarcity of allied health staff at the research sites over weekends suggested that day of admission may alter care . patient outcomes following stroke have been associated with previous levels of independence and accommodation,22,23 comorbidity levels,24,25 and length of stay in the acute hospital.26,27 these factors may influence allied health staff decisions regarding care , for example , the priority given to early rehabilitation interventions . factors such as length of stay may also influence the achievability of some care processes for patients . we considered english proficiency in our study because it has previously been linked to stroke outcomes and the quality of health care patients receive.28,29 a simple causal pathway was constructed to assist in our understanding of how to undertake the analysis of the putative predictors of the allied health indicators of care . this approach was based on the causal modeling theory of rothman and greenland.30 we called this a simple causal pathway because we had no understanding at this point of the ongoing influence of early predictor variables on other variables which become important along the pathway . we undertook a series of analyses to understand the relationships between the putative predictor variables and each care process indicator , using our causal pathway as an analysis model . univariate logistic regression models were constructed between : adherence with individual process indicators and age ; adherence with individual process indicators and non - age predictor variables ; the association of age with other predictor variables ; and the association between non - age variables . data were analyzed using sas proprietary software ( v 9.2 ; sas institute , cary , nc ) . correlations between variables were expressed as relative risks , odds ratios ( or , as appropriate ) , and 95% confidence intervals ( ci ) . we report relative risks for the first two of the analyses because we were examining associations between independent care predictors with dependent variables ( indicators of care quality derived from cross -

related differences in care , researchers have reported associations between gender and stroke care quality.1618 stroke severity is strongly linked to survival and discharge destination outcomes,19,20 and a priori reasoning suggests that it may prompt allied health care processes , such as swallow assessment , in patients with obvious risks of poor outcome . stroke severity may also influence the ease with which specific care , such as early rehabilitation , can be achieved . admission over a weekend has previously been reported to influence care standards and patient outcomes following acute stroke.12,21 the scarcity of allied health staff at the research sites over weekends suggested that day of admission may alter care . patient outcomes following stroke have been associated with previous levels of independence and accommodation,22,23 comorbidity levels,24,25 and length of stay in the acute hospital.26,27 these factors may influence allied health staff decisions regarding care , for example , the priority given to early rehabilitation interventions . factors such as length of stay may also influence the achievability of some care processes for patients . we considered english proficiency in our study because it has previously been linked to stroke outcomes and the quality of health care patients receive.28,29 a simple causal pathway was constructed to assist in our understanding of how to undertake the analysis of the putative predictors of the allied health indicators of care . this approach was based on the causal modeling theory of rothman and greenland.30 we called this a simple causal pathway because we had no understanding at this point of the ongoing influence of early predictor variables on other variables which become important along the pathway . we undertook a series of analyses to understand the relationships between the putative predictor variables and each care process indicator , using our causal pathway as an analysis model . univariate logistic regression models were constructed between : adherence with individual process indicators and age ; adherence with individual process indicators and non - age predictor variables ; the association of age with other predictor variables ; and the association between non - age variables . data were analyzed using sas proprietary software ( v 9.2 ; sas institute , cary , nc ) . correlations between variables were expressed as relative risks , odds ratios ( or , as appropriate ) , and 95% confidence intervals ( ci ) . we report relative risks for the first two of the analyses because we were examining associations between independent care predictors with dependent variables ( indicators of care quality derived from cross - sectional observational data ) . we reported or for the third and fourth analyses because we were examining the association between independent variables . as reported in our earlier paper , age was most appropriately dichotomized as younger ( < 75 years ) and older ( 75 + years ) patients.14 stroke severity on admission was determined by retrospectively extracting data from medical records to complete a national institute of health stroke scale ( nihss ) for each patient . the nihss is a widely used , valid , and reliable measure of stroke severity.31,32 it is also reliable and valid when data are extracted retrospectively from patient medical records.33,34 based on previous stroke studies , nihss scores were divided into three groups for analysis , ie , mild strokes ( nihss < 8) , moderate severity strokes ( nihss 816 ) , and severe strokes ( nihss > 16).35 comorbidity levels were measured using the charlson comorbidity index ( cci ) , which is a summary score of the existence or absence of 17 medical conditions , weighted to account for disease severity.36 this index has been validated as a predictive comorbidity index for patients with stroke . it has been used in previous stroke outcome studies and has also been validity and reliability tested for retrospective data extraction.37,38 comorbidity information was extracted from the medical records to complete a cci for each patient . based on analysis reported in previous studies , patient cci scores were dichotomized as low comorbidity levels ( cci  1 ) vs high comorbidity levels ( cci > 1).38 patients admitted between 1600 hours on a friday and 2400 hours on a sunday , when access to allied health professionals was scarce , were recorded as weekend admissions . admission directly from the emergency department to a stroke unit was recorded in binary terms ( yes = 1 , no = 0 ) . nonaphasic patients were recorded as not proficient in english if there was evidence that assistance had been required with language translation , or if  limited english  or similar was found in the medical records . premorbid dependence level was recorded as independent or dependent , according to whether assistance was required with activities of daily living or instrumental activities of daily living.39 premorbid accommodation was recorded as a private home or a residential care facility ( nursing home or hostel ) . length of stay data ( in days ) was broadly classified for analysis . for univariate analysis , length of stay was dichotomized into shorter stay ( < 12 days ) and longer stay ( 12 days ) . the cut point of 12 days was the mean length of stay for the data set and was also the average length of stay for acute stroke patients at the three data collection hospitals in 2007/08 and 2008/09.40 to provide more detailed consideration of the possible influence of length of stay on care , analysis considered length of stay in three groups divided at the data tertiles ( < 4 days , 49 days , and 10 days ) . mean age at stroke onset was 74.7 years ( standard deviation [ sd ] : 13.5 , range 18100 years ) . the mean length of stay in acute care was 12.5 days ( sd : 15.6 , range 198 days ) . the sample was proportionally balanced for gender . despite similar mean ages for males and females , a larger proportion of females were in the older age groups , with 72% females aged 75 years or older , compared with 53% of males . a greater proportion of females suffered a moderate or severe stroke ( 28% ) than males ( 18% ) . for the whole sample , there were weak relationships between increasing age and increasing stroke severity ( r = 0.21 ) and comorbidity levels ( r = 0.20 ) . compliance with each process indicator was generally poor ( table 2 , columns 2 and 3 ) . for 16 of the process indicators ( 80% ) , the outcome of univariate logistic regression models , associating process indicator adherence with age , is reported as relative risks in table 2 , column 4 . only one process indicator had a significant association with age , where patients younger than 75 years were significantly more likely to receive first mobilization within 24 hours of stroke onset than older patients . compliance with 12 of the 20 process indicators ( 60% ) was significantly correlated with non - age variables . the only variables which were not associated with any process indicator compliance were previous accommodation type and english proficiency . for 30% of the process indicators significant correlations were found between patient age , and the predictor variables of stroke severity , comorbidity levels , premorbid accommodation , premorbid independence level , gender , english proficiency , and length of stay . in summary , compared with younger patients , patients 75 years or older were significantly more likely to have a moderate -

age variables for their relevance to quality of allied health care . for example , an association between previous accommodation and previous independence was impossible to assess because all patients in residential care were , by default , also dependent . when this is considered in the light of earlier findings , previous independence may be the more important predictor variable because it is associated with process indicator compliance and has a stronger correlation than accommodation , with age . the complex confounding associations between the various non - age predictor variables are illustrated in figure 2 . in figure 3 we revisit our initial causal pathway , adding in the associations found between adherence to allied health process indicators , and the early predictor variables captured in patient demographic and stroke event data . this new pathway summarizes the journey for patients admitted with acute stroke and the multiple factors that can impact on the care they receive from allied health professionals . mean age at stroke onset was 74.7 years ( standard deviation [ sd ] : 13.5 , range 18100 years ) . the mean length of stay in acute care was 12.5 days ( sd : 15.6 , range 198 days ) . the sample was proportionally balanced for gender . despite similar mean ages for males and females , a larger proportion of females were in the older age groups , with 72% females aged 75 years or older , compared with 53% of males . a greater proportion of females suffered a moderate or severe stroke ( 28% ) than males ( 18% ) . for the whole sample , there were weak relationships between increasing age and increasing stroke severity ( r = 0.21 ) and comorbidity levels ( r = 0.20 ) . compliance with each process indicator was generally poor ( table 2 , columns 2 and 3 ) . for 16 of the process indicators ( 80% ) , the outcome of univariate logistic regression models , associating process indicator adherence with age , is reported as relative risks in table 2 , column 4 . only one process indicator had a significant association with age , where patients younger than 75 years were significantly more likely to receive first mobilization within 24 hours of stroke onset than older patients . compliance with 12 of the 20 process indicators ( 60% ) was significantly correlated with non -

age variables were more frequently correlated with process indicator compliance ( twelve indicators ) than was patient age . stroke severity was the most frequent predictor variable ( seven process indicators ) , with length of stay the second most common predictor ( five process indicators ) . this analysis also demonstrated the lack of importance of some non - age variables , such as previous residential care accommodation data made redundant by data on previous independence . it is possible that systematic variations between professions may contribute to age - related differences in the medical care provided following stroke , which do not apply to allied health care . it is recognized , for example , that older patients are under - represented in some of the primary stroke research which guides evidence - based medical diagnostics and interventions.3 patients over 80 years have been excluded from many thrombolysis trials,41 and similar age exclusions are reported for secondary prevention stroke medications.42 the evidence base for allied health stroke care is still in early development and may therefore have less influence on which patients receive particular elements of care . as well as practicing within the biomedical framework adopted by medical practice , many areas of care provided by allied health professionals also fit within a biopsychosocial model.43 these differences may result in different clinical reasoning processes and decision - making by the separate professions . allied health professional decision - making regarding the care delivered to patients with stroke has not been well explored . there may be complex influences on the decisions they make about the care they provide to patients with acute stroke , underpinned by their perspectives of the role of non - age predictor variables on patient outcome . our causal pathway ( figures 1 and 2 ) suggests that many factors can not be adjusted because they are a priori to the stroke . ensuring the highest quality of allied health care for all stroke patients is important in the current climate of scarce resources and the increasing burden of stroke to the health sector . the associations identified between independent variables , including patient age , indicate that there are unlikely to be simple explanations for why some patients receive recommended care and others do not . to understand fully the important factors influencing the quality of care provided to acute stroke patients by allied health professionals will require further investigations into their perspectives on the capacity of stroke patients to improve , and how they make care decisions .",

    "document": "For several decades the federal government has funded efforts to explore the feasibility of mitigating the release of greenhouse gases (GHGs) while burning fossil fuels as a source of energy. Carbon capture and storage (CCS)\u00e2\u0080\u0094the process of capturing manmade carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) at its source, such as a coal-fired power plant, and storing it underground instead of releasing into the atmosphere\u00e2\u0080\u0094has been proposed as a technological solution for mitigating emissions while using fossil energy. Federal policies on CCS have received support in recent Congresses, including support for research and development (R&D) and expansion of tax credits for carbon storage. The U.S. Fourth National Climate Assessment, released in 2018, states that \"the impacts of global climate change are already being felt in the United States and are projected to intensify in the future\u00e2\u0080\u0094but the severity of future impacts will depend largely on actions taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to adapt to the changes that will occur.\" This report focuses on federal policy regarding the underground carbon storage stage of CCS. Underground carbon storage is achieved through geologic sequestration and as an incidental benefit of enhanced oil recovery (EOR), which both use injection by well to place CO 2 into deep subsurface geologic formations. Geologic sequestration involves storing CO 2 by placing it permanently in an underground formation. This process is being tested in the United States and several other countries, including several large-scale late-stage R&D projects. EOR involves injecting CO 2 to produce additional oil and gas from underground reservoirs and has been used in the United States since the 1970s. Both geologic sequestration and EOR are regulated under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) for the purpose of protecting underground sources of drinking water (USDWs). The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and delegated states administer sections of SDWA relevant to underground injection and carbon storage. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) also engages in underground carbon storage through supporting R&D activities. Congress has supported carbon storage via underground injection through recent legislation directing DOE to expand R&D activity and increasing the federal tax credit for underground carbon storage. As Congress considers policies on underground carbon storage, including geologic sequestration and EOR, Members may wish to consider the current regulatory framework and status of federal and federally sponsored activities in this area. This report provides background on underground injection and geologic sequestration processes and related federal R&D. It then analyzes the federal framework for regulating land-based underground injection of CO 2 both for geologic sequestration and EOR. Finally, it includes a discussion of several policy issues for Congress and recent relevant federal legislation. Not covered in this report are research and management of CCS elements not directly related to underground injection, including carbon capture and the pipeline and transportation infrastructure for captured CO 2 . Regulation of geologic sequestration on federal land and offshore geologic sequestration of CO 2 are also beyond the scope of this report. For additional information on the technical aspects of CCS, see CRS Report R44902, Carbon Capture and Sequestration (CCS) in the United States , by Peter Folger. Underground injection has been used for decades to dispose of a variety of fluids, including oil field brines (salty water) and industrial, manufacturing, mining, pharmaceutical, and municipal wastes. Injection wells are also used to enhance oil and gas recovery; for solution mining; and, more recently, to inject CO 2 for geologic sequestration. As of 2018, EPA estimated that there were more than 734,000 permitted injection wells in the United States. According to one estimate, approximately 750 billion gallons (2.8 million tons) of oil field brine are injected underground each year in the United States. CO 2 injection wells are a type of deep injection well used for injection into deep-isolated rock formations. These wells can reach thousands of feet deep. More details on specific well types are provided later in this report. Geologic sequestration is the long-term containment of a fluid (including a gas, liquid, or supercritical CO 2 stream) in subsurface geologic formations. The goal of geologic sequestration of CO 2 is to trap or transform CO 2 emitted from stationary anthropogenic sources permanently underground and ultimately reduce emissions of GHGs from these sources into the atmosphere. CO 2 for sequestration is first captured from a large stationary source, such as a coal-fired power plant or chemical production facility. Although CO 2 is initially captured as a gas, it is compressed into a supercritical fluid\u00e2\u0080\u0094a relatively dense fluid intermediate to a gas and a liquid\u00e2\u0080\u0094before injection and remains in that state due to high pressures in the underground formation. The CO 2 is injected through specially designed wells into geologic formations, typically a half a mile or more below the Earth's surface. These formations include, for example, large deep saline reservoirs (underground basins containing salty fluids) and oil and gas reservoirs no longer in production. Research shows that CO 2 could also be sequestered in deep ocean waters or mineralized. Impermeable rocks above the target reservoir, combined with high CO 2 pressures, keep the CO 2 in a supercritical fluid state and prevent migration into shallower groundwater or into other formations. The National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) estimates that the total onshore storage capacity in the United States ranges between about 2.6 trillion and 22 trillion metric tons (hereinafter tons in this report) of CO 2 . (For more details, see Appendix A .) By comparison, U.S. energy-related CO 2 emissions in 2018 totaled 5,269 million tons. Theoretically, the United States contains storage capacity to store all CO 2 emissions from large stationary sources (such as power plants), at the current rate of emissions, for centuries. For additional information on the technical aspects of CCS, see CRS Report R44902, Carbon Capture and Sequestration (CCS) in the United States , and CRS Report R41325, Carbon Capture: A Technology Assessment , by Peter Folger. Use of wells to inject CO 2 builds on known processes. Much of the technology is adopted from well-established experience in the oil and gas industry, which as of 2014, injected approximately 68 million tons of CO 2 underground each year in a process known as EOR. Enhanced recovery is also used occasionally in natural gas development. EOR can significantly increase the amount of oil or gas produced from a reservoir. CO 2 is the most common injection agent used in EOR projects. CO 2 injected for EOR most commonly comes from natural sources, such as underground CO 2 reservoirs, but some is also captured from anthropogenic sources, such as natural gas production, ammonia production, and coal gasification facilities. In many cases, the CO 2 is transferred from the source to the injection site by pipeline. The CO 2 is typically injected into depleted oil or gas reservoirs using the existing well infrastructure from the original production process. The injected CO 2 travels through the pore spaces of the formation, where it combines with residual oil. The mixture is then pumped to the surface, where the CO 2 is separated from other fluids, recompressed, and reinjected. Through repeated EOR cycles, CO 2 is gradually stored in the reservoir. NETL reports that generally, between 30% and 40% of the CO 2 is stored in each injection cycle, depending on the reservoir characteristics, through what it terms \"incidental storage.\" This portion of the CO 2 \"will be contained indefinitely within the reservoir,\" according to NETL. In 2017, commercial CO 2 -EOR projects were operating in 80 oil fields in the United States, primarily located in the Permian Basin of western Texas. Some analysts project that the federal tax credit for carbon storage and the potential increased supply of CO 2 from carbon capture could lead to expansion in both the number and locations of CO 2 injection for EOR operations. Over the last decade, the focus of federal carbon storage R&D efforts, including geologic sequestration and EOR, has shifted from small demonstration projects to exploration of its technical and commercial viability for storing large volumes of captured CO 2 . DOE leads the federal government's underground carbon storage R&D as part of the agency's fossil energy programs. DOE's work includes conducting fundamental laboratory research on wells, storage design, geologic settings, and monitoring and assessment of the injected CO 2 . In 2003, DOE created the Regional Carbon Sequestration Partnerships (RCSP) program\u00e2\u0080\u0094a set of public-private partnerships across the United States to characterize, validate, and develop large-scale field testing of CO 2 injection and storage methods. The RCSP program supports these R&D projects, which include carbon storage through geologic sequestration and EOR, through partnerships with the petroleum and chemical industries and public and private research institutions. Congress has supported DOE's carbon storage work through appropriations and, beginning in 2005, through enacting legislation directing DOE to establish programs in this area. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPAct, P.L. 109-58 ), Section 963, directed DOE to carry out a 10-year carbon capture R&D program to develop technologies for use in new and existing coal combustion facilities. Among the specified objectives of this program, Congress directed DOE, \"in accordance with the carbon dioxide capture program, to promote a robust carbon sequestration program\" and continue R&D work through carbon sequestration partnerships. EPAct Section 354 directed the agency to establish a demonstration program to inject CO 2 for the purposes of EOR while increasing the sequestration of CO 2 . The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA, P.L. 110-140 ) amended EPAct Section 963 and expanded DOE's work in carbon sequestration R&D and demonstration. EISA Title VII, Subtitle A, directed DOE to conduct fundamental science and engineering research in carbon capture and sequestration and to conduct geologic sequestration training and research. Subtitle A also specifically directed DOE to carry out at least seven large-scale projects testing carbon sequestration systems in a diversity of formations, which could include RCSP projects. Subtitle B directed DOE to conduct a national assessment for onshore capacity for CO 2 sequestration. To date in the United States, nine DOE-supported projects have injected large volumes of CO 2 into underground formations as part of CCS systems or related EOR R&D projects (see Appendix B ). Three of these active projects involve injection into saline formations for geologic sequestration (for demonstration purposes), five involve injection for EOR purposes, and one involves both sequestration and EOR. Four of these projects are currently injecting and/or storing CO 2 . The Petra Nova facility in Texas is the first operating industrial-scale coal-fired electricity generating plant with a CCS system in the United States. The captured CO 2 is transported by pipeline to an oil field where it is injected for EOR. The project is jointly owned by several energy companies and was partially funded by DOE. In Decatur, IL, ADM is injecting CO 2 from its ethanol production plant into an onsite sandstone formation for geologic sequestration. The Air Products Carbon Capture Project in Port Arthur, TX, has been injecting CO 2 captured from steam methane reformers since 2013 as part of EOR operations. Each of these projects received funds from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA, P.L. 111-5 ). The Michigan Basin Project in Otsego County, MI, is injecting CO 2 from a natural gas facility for EOR. DOE provides partial funding for this project through the RCSP program. All of the projects operate through collaborations among DOE, industry, and local research institutions. Five other projects that injected CO 2 were implemented through the RCSP program. The projects included sequestration into various underground formations and storage associated with EOR with volumes of CO 2 injected and stored ranging from a few hundred tons to over 1 million tons (considered commercial-scale). The RCSP program is currently in the development phase, which DOE defines as large-scale field testing of high volumes of CO 2 storage. These projects have completed injection and are now in the post-injection monitoring phase. All of the existing RCSP projects are scheduled to end by July 2022, but DOE is in the process of selecting additional projects for the program. In the United States, while numerous large-scale storage R&D projects are ongoing, none of the projects injecting CO 2 solely for geologic sequestration are operating in a commercial capacity. Worldwide, public-private partnerships have implemented several CO 2 geologic sequestration projects in diverse regions. There are two active projects, both in Norway, where facilities at the Sleipner Gas Field in the North Sea and Snohvit in the Barents Sea conduct offshore sequestration under the Norwegian continental shelf. Chevron's Gorgon Injection Project, a natural gas production facility in Australia, plans to begin sequestering CO 2 in 2020 and store a total of 100 million tons of CO 2 . Canada, Japan and Algeria have carried out smaller-scale CCS projects with sequestration in saline reservoirs. This section provides an overview of the federal framework for regulating underground injection of CO 2 for both geologic sequestration and EOR. It describes the primary federal statute for underground injection control (UIC), the general federal and state roles in developing and implementing UIC regulations, and the UIC well classes. The section analyzes the differences between wells used solely for geologic sequestration and wells used for EOR. It also outlines the regulatory requirements for transitioning from EOR wells to geologic sequestration wells. SDWA is the primary federal statute governing underground injection activities in the United States, including those associated with geologic sequestration of CO 2 . SDWA Section 1421 directs EPA to promulgate regulations for state UIC programs to protect underground sources of drinking water and prohibits any underground injection activity except when authorized by a permit or rule. The statute defines underground injection as \"the subsurface emplacement of fluids by well injection.\" EPA issues regulations for underground injection, issues guidance to support state program implementation, and in some cases, directly administers UIC programs in states. The agency has established minimum requirements for state UIC programs and permitting for injection wells. These requirements include performance standards for well construction, operation and maintenance, monitoring and testing, reporting and recordkeeping, site closure, financial responsibility, and (for some types of wells) post-injection site care. Most states implement the day-to-day program elements for most categories of wells, which are grouped into \"classes\" based on the type of fluid injected. Owners or operators of underground injection wells must follow the permitting requirements and standards established by the UIC program authorities in their states. SDWA authorizes EPA to delegate primary enforcement authority for UIC programs, known as primacy , to individual states (see Figure 2 ). Section 1422 mandates that states seeking primacy adopt and implement UIC programs that meet all minimum federal requirements under Section 1421. For wells other than certain oil- and gas-related injection wells, states must adopt laws and regulations at least as stringent as EPA regulations and meet other statutory requirements to be granted primacy. EPA grants a state primacy through a federal rulemaking process for one or more classes of wells. If granted primacy for a class of wells, a state administers that UIC program, develops its own requirements, and allows well injection by state rule or by issuing permits. If a state's UIC plan has not been approved or the state has chosen not to assume program responsibility, SDWA requires that EPA directly implement the program in that state. Under SDWA authority, EPA has established six classes of underground injection wells based on similarity in the fluids injected. Construction, injection depth, design requirements, and operating techniques vary among well classes. Some wells are used to inject fluids into formations below USDWs, while others involve injection into or above USDWs. EPA regulations set out specific permitting and performance standards for each class of wells. In 2010, EPA issued the first federal rule specific to underground injection of CO 2 , Federal Requirements Under the Underground Control (UIC) Program for Carbon Dioxide (CO 2 ) Geological Sequestration (Class VI Rule). In the rule, the agency promulgated regulations for underground injection of CO 2 for long-term storage and established UIC Class VI, a new class of wells for geologic sequestration of CO 2 . Prior to the Class VI rule's effective date in January 2011, injection of CO 2 was permitted under Class II if used for EOR or Class V if the well was experimental (e.g., DOE-supported research wells). Table 1 lists the classes of UIC wells. EPA has delegated UIC program primacy for well Classes I-V to 32 states (see Figure 2 ). EPA has delegated primacy for all six well classes to one state, North Dakota. Seven states and two tribes have primacy for Class II wells only. Including those states, a total of 40 states have primacy for Class II. For Class VI, EPA has direct implementation authority in 49 states and for all territories. For Classes I, III, IV and V only, the agency has delegated primacy for two states. EPA shares UIC implementation responsibility with seven states and two Indian tribes and implements the UIC program for all classes in eight states. Additional states are pursuing Class VI primacy: EPA is reviewing Wyoming's application for Class VI primacy, and Louisiana is in a pre-application phase. As with regulations for other well classes, the Class VI rule allows states to apply for primacy for Class VI wells without applying for primacy for other well classes. Underground injection for the purpose of long-term geologic sequestration of CO 2 is subject to SDWA UIC regulations for Class VI wells. Class VI requirements may also apply to CO 2 injection for EOR using Class II wells when EPA or the delegated state determines that there is an increased risk to USDWs. Two Class VI wells, both in Illinois, are currently permitted in the United States. EPA issued these final permits in 2017 for two wells injecting CO 2 into a saline aquifer at the ADM ethanol plant in Illinois. In 2015, EPA issued a final Class VI permit for the FutureGen project, but the permit expired after the project was cancelled without any CO 2 injection taking place. No state has issued a permit for a Class VI well. EPA requires that state primacy for Class VI wells would be implemented under SDWA Section 1422. When developing minimum federal requirements for Class VI wells, EPA generally built upon Class I hazardous waste requirements. The agency added new requirements to address the unique properties of CO 2 and geologic sequestration in the Class VI rule. In the preamble to the Class VI rule, EPA noted that \"tailored requirements, modeled on the existing UIC regulatory framework, are necessary to manage the unique nature of CO 2 injection for geologic sequestration.\" EPA bases the regulation of CO 2 injection as a separate class of wells on several unique risk factors to USDWs: \u00c2\u00a0 the large volumes of CO 2 expected to be injected through wells; the relative buoyancy of CO 2 in underground geologic formations; the mobility of CO 2 within subsurface formations; the corrosive properties of CO 2 in the presence of water that can effect well materials; and the potential presence of impurities in the injected CO 2 stream. Due to all of these properties, Class VI requirements establish a larger injection site \"area of review\" compared to requirements for other classes. The area of review for Class VI wells \"includes the subsurface three-dimensional extent of the carbon dioxide plume, associated area of elevated pressure, and displaced fluids, as well as the surface area above that delineated region.\" The requirements also obligate well owners or operators to track, model, and predict CO 2 plume movement. The monitoring and post-injection site care requirements in the regulations are based on estimates that commercial-scale CO 2 injection projects are expected to operate between 30 and 60 years. Appendix C compares the major permitting requirements and technical standards for Class II wells related to oil and gas production, which are used for EOR, and Class VI wells for geologic sequestration of CO 2 . To assist states and owner operators with the permitting process, EPA has also issued 11 technical guidance documents on Class VI wells. These documents are not legally enforceable but provide additional information on site characterization, area of review, construction, reporting and recordkeeping, site closure, financial responsibility, and other permit elements. Class II wells are used to inject fluids associated with oil and gas production, including wells injecting CO 2 for EOR. EOR wells are the most common type of Class II wells. As of 2018, there were approximately 178,000 permitted Class II wells, approximately 135,600 (76%) of which were recovery wells. Most of these wells are located in California, Texas, Kansas, Illinois, and Oklahoma. Approximately 20% of Class II wells are disposal wells and hydrocarbon storage wells. States may request primacy for Class II oil- and gas-related injection operations under SDWA Section 1422 or Section 1425. Section 1422 mandates that state programs meet EPA requirements promulgated under Section 1421 and prohibits underground injection that is not authorized by permit or rule. EPA regulations under Section 1421 specify requirements for siting, construction, operation, monitoring and testing, closure, corrective action, financial responsibility, and reporting and recordkeeping. Sixteen states and three territories have Class II primacy under Section 1422. Section 1425 allows states to administer their own Class II UIC programs using state rules in lieu of EPA regulations provided a state demonstrates that it has an effective program that prevents underground injection that endangers drinking water sources. To receive approval under Section 1425's optional demonstration provisions, a state program must include permitting, inspection, monitoring, and recordkeeping and reporting requirements. Twenty-four states and two tribes have Class II primacy under Section 1425. Most oil- and gas-producing states have primacy for Class II under this section. Overall, nearly 99% of EOR wells are located in states with primacy under Section 1425. For the 10 states without Class II primacy, the District of Columbia, and most tribes, EPA directly implements the Class II program, and federal regulations apply. While both Class II and Class VI wells involve injection of CO 2 into underground reservoirs, the purposes and regulations of these two classes are different. Class II wells inject primarily into oil or gas fields for the purposes of enhancing production from an underground oil and gas reservoir. In Class II wells, only some of the CO 2 stays in the reservoir during each recovery cycle, gradually increasing the total volume of CO 2 stored. In Class VI wells, all of the injected CO 2 is intended to remain in the reservoir for sequestration. CO 2 sequestration in Class VI wells generally involves higher injection pressures, larger expected fluid volumes, and different physical and chemical properties of the injection stream compared to Class II wells. Given these differences between the two well classes, EPA Class II regulations specify different requirements than Class VI regulations. Generally, EPA Class II requirements impose less comprehensive performance requirements and provide longer time periods between mandatory testing and reporting compared to EPA Class VI requirements. Unlike EPA Class VI requirements, EPA Class II requirements do not include providing seismicity information, continuous monitoring of the injection pressure and CO 2 stream, monitoring of the CO 2 plume and pressure front, or monitoring of groundwater quality throughout the lifetime of the project. EPA Class II requirements also do not impose post-injection site care or emergency and remedial response requirements, which are included in EPA Class VI requirements. Class II wells can be granted a permit or authorized by rule by either a primacy state or EPA, while Class VI wells cannot be authorized by rule. See Appendix C for more information on EPA Class II well requirements. Class II EOR wells have a different primary purpose than Class VI wells and must transition to a Class VI permit under certain conditions. EPA has determined that \"owners or operators of Class II wells that are injecting carbon dioxide for the primary purpose of long-term storage into an oil or gas reservoir must apply for and obtain a Class VI permit where there is an increased risk to USDWs compared to traditional Class II operations.\" EPA recognizes that there may be some CO 2 trapped in the subsurface at EOR operations. However, if the Class VI UIC program director (either EPA or the primacy state) has determined that there is no increased risk to USDWs, then these operations would continue to be permitted under the Class II requirements. To date, no Class II wells have been transitioned to Class VI. Regulations promulgated under most other federal environmental statutes have generally not applied to underground injection or geologic sequestration of CO 2 . If the well owner or operator constructs, operates, and closes the injection well in accordance with a UIC Class II or Class VI permit, the injection and storage would typically not be subject to other federal air quality, waste management, or environmental response authorities and related liability. For example, a release of a hazardous substance in compliance with a UIC permit would be exempt as a \"federally permitted release\" from liability and reporting requirements of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA). Such federally permitted releases would also be exempt from emergency notification requirements of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA). During the development of the UIC Class VI final rule, some stakeholders in the CCS industry asked EPA for clarification on how hazardous waste requirements, established under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), may apply to CO 2 streams that are geologically sequestered. In response, EPA promulgated a rule excluding CO 2 from RCRA's hazardous waste management requirements when injected into UIC Class VI wells. As a result, when geologically sequestered in compliance with a UIC Class VI well permit, CO 2 streams are not separately subject to RCRA requirements applicable to the management of hazardous waste. Certain federal regulations may apply to CCS processes or facilities that support CO 2 injection and sequestration, such as carbon capture and CO 2 transportation and compression. The regulatory frameworks of these activities are beyond the scope of this report. The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP) established by EPA under the authority of the Clean Air Act, requires certain sources of GHGs to report emissions data. In 2010, EPA promulgated a rule to include injection and geologic sequestration of CO 2 in the GHGRP. In this rule, the agency determined that facilities that inject CO 2 for long-term sequestration and all other facilities that inject CO 2 underground fall within the GHGRP covered source categories. Therefore, reporting requirements apply to both Class VI wells and Class II wells that inject CO 2 . EPA's purpose for collecting this information is two-fold: to track CO 2 emissions and to quantify the amount of CO 2 being sequestered. Under the GHGRP Rule Subpart RR, facilities that inject a CO 2 stream for long-term containment (i.e., geologic sequestration) must develop and implement a monitoring, reporting, and verification plan. The purpose of this plan is to verify the amount of CO 2 sequestered and collect data on any CO 2 surface emissions from geologic sequestration facilities. Any facility holding a Class VI permit would be subject to Subpart RR and be required to report the mass of CO 2 that is received, injected into the subsurface, produced, emitted by surface leakage, emitted by leaks in equipment, and emitted by venting. Facilities must also report the mass of CO 2 sequestered in subsurface geologic formations. Subpart UU of the rule applies to Class II wells\u00e2\u0080\u0094for the injection of CO 2 for EOR and for small and experimental sequestration projects exempted under Subpart RR. Subpart UU does not require a monitoring, reporting, and verification plan and sets forth different requirements for monitoring and reporting. If Congress were to address carbon storage through underground injection, there are a variety of policy issues Members may consider. Several policy issues relate to the current SDWA UIC regulatory framework and what elements of CO 2 injection are covered under the statute's purpose and approach. Congress may also wish to consider other issues that may have implications for CO 2 injection and storage policy, including current pathways of federal support for CCS and underground carbon storage, project cost, and stakeholder perspectives on CCS and fossil fuels. SDWA currently serves as the major federal authority for regulating injection of CO 2 for geologic sequestration and carbon storage in general. However, the major purpose of the act's UIC provisions is to prevent endangerment of public water supplies and sources from injection activities. In the preamble to the proposed Class VI Rule, EPA states, \"While the SDWA provides EPA with the authority to develop regulations to protect USDWs from endangerment, it does not provide authority to develop regulations for all areas related to GS [geologic sequestration].\" The agency identified specific policy areas related to geologic sequestration that are beyond the agency's authority, including (but not limited to) capture and transport of CO 2 , managing human health and environmental risks other than drinking water endangerment, determining property rights, and transfer of liability from one entity to another. The agency acknowledges the challenge of balancing SDWA goals with broader efforts to support geologic sequestration. In the preamble to the Class VI Rule, EPA noted that the rule \"ensures protection of USDWs while also providing regulatory certainty to industry and permitting authorities and an increased understanding of GS through public participation and outreach.\" Federal agencies, external analysts, and other stakeholders have expressed a variety of viewpoints on the potential risks associated with injection and geologic sequestration of CO 2 . EPA, the Interagency Task Force on Carbon Capture and Storage, and others have recognized that CO 2 injection and sequestration activities may convey risks to the environment and human health. Some of these risks involve potential endangerment of USDWs that would be covered by SDWA. Other potential impacts, however, are not covered by SDWA or the UIC implementing regulations. For groundwater-related risks, EPA has noted that expansion of CO 2 -EOR and associated CO 2 storage could increase the risk of endangerment to USDWs due to increased injection zone pressures and the large number of wells in oil and gas fields that could serve as leakage pathways. Injected CO 2 could also force brine from the target formation into USDWs, which could affect drinking water. To address potential releases or leakage that could endanger USDWs, in the Class VI rule, EPA included monitoring, reporting, and recordkeeping requirements specific to CO 2 injection. Class VI construction and testing requirements, which are generally more stringent than Class II requirements for EOR, are also intended to prevent USDW endangerment. Regarding other types of risk from improperly managed projects, EPA identified risks to air quality, human health, and ecosystems as potential concerns not addressed by SDWA authorities. In its 2010 report, the Task Force concluded that SDWA's limited application to only those groundwater formations that meet the specific statutory definition of USDWs may \"require clarification to support actions to address or remedy ecological or non-drinking water human health impacts arising from the injection and sequestration of CO 2 .\" The Task Force also stated that an accidental large release could result in risks to surface water, local ecology, and human health. (See text box Human Health and Environmental Considerations of CO 2 and Geologic Sequestration .) An additional concern with injection and sequestration of CO 2 is the increased potential for earthquakes associated with deep-well injection. Earthquakes induced by CO 2 injection could fracture the rocks in the reservoir or, more importantly, the caprock above the reservoir. Class VI well regulations require that information on earthquake-related history be included in the permit application and that owners or operators not exceed injection pressure that would induce seismicity or initiate fractures. NETL and other stakeholders offer other perspectives on potential health and environmental risks. Regarding the risks of CO 2 leakage, NETL outlines several case studies on leakage related to underground carbon storage in a 2019 report. The report states that use of EOR in the United States \"has demonstrated that large volumes of gas can be stored safely underground and over long timeframes when the appropriate best-practices are implemented.\" According to the report, \"Despite over 40 years of operating CO 2 EOR projects, leakage events have rarely been reported,\" although the authors also note that \"there has been no official mechanism for reporting leaks of CO 2 until recently.\" Other stakeholders have also commented that, even given potential health and environmental risks, the benefits of CO 2 sequestration in reducing GHG emissions as part of climate change mitigation efforts outweigh such risks. In the Class VI rule, EPA acknowledged stakeholder interest in liability and long-term stewardship but noted that that the agency does not have the authority to determine property rights or transfer liability from one owner or operator to another. In its report, the Task Force also identified that \"the existing Federal framework largely does not provide for a release or transfer of liability from the owner/operator to other persons\" and noted that some stakeholders view these issues as a barrier to future CCS project deployment. Specific policy questions regarding property rights include who owns and controls the subsurface formations (known as the pore space) targeted for CO 2 sequestration, if and how such property can be transferred or aggregated, and how underground reservoirs that cross state and tribal boundaries should be regulated. State laws and contractual property arrangements, similar to those established for oil and gas development, may address some of these questions, but some analysts identify the need for more clarity. Issues of financial liability and long-term stewardship of injection sites and storage reservoirs also remain largely unresolved. Analysts have raised questions such as (1) who is responsible for the site and reservoir after the 50-year mandated post-injection site care period, (2) what is the role of the federal or state government in assisting site developers and operators with managing the risks associated with sequestration activities, and (3) whether the federal government should be involved in taking on some or all financial responsibility during the life-cycle of sequestration projects. Large-scale commercial geologic sequestration projects would likely require unique liability and stewardship structures that address issues such as the particular characteristics of CO 2 , the entire life-cycle of sequestration projects\u00e2\u0080\u0094from site selection to periods beyond site closure\u00e2\u0080\u0094and the geologic time frame (hundreds or thousands of years) over which sequestration occurs. For more information on legal sequestration issues, see CRS Report RL34307, Legal Issues Associated with the Development of Carbon Dioxide Sequestration Technology , by Adam Vann and Paul W. Parfomak. EPA has stated that \"a supporting regulatory framework for the future development and deployment of [carbon storage] technology can provide the regulatory certainty needed to foster industry adoption of CCS, which is crucial to supporting the goal of any climate change legislation.\" Even with the completion of several large-scale demonstration field projects, analysts recognize uncertainties regarding wide-spread commercial CCS operation in the United States. These technical issues include uncertainties in operations, such as how much CO 2 would be injected, CO 2 sources, availability of appropriate locations, and the exact constituents of CO 2 injection streams. A lack of existing infrastructure for CCS systems\u00e2\u0080\u0094from capture technology to pipelines to transport CO 2 \u00e2\u0080\u0094may also act as barriers to future CCS deployment. Congress has directly supported federal activities in both geologic sequestration of CO 2 and EOR through the EPAct in 2005 and EISA in 2007, directing DOE to carry out R&D activities to further technical knowledge and deployment of CCS. Several bills in the 116 th Congress\u00e2\u0080\u0094including H.R. 1166 / S. 383 , H.R. 3607 , and S. 1201 \u00e2\u0080\u0094would continue or expand DOE's CCS programs, including carbon storage programs. Some of these bills would direct EPA to conduct CCS research and/or direct DOE to develop and implement R&D programs related to geologic sequestration methods, storage siting, and assessment of potential impacts. Provisions in some of these bills would also direct DOE to continue its partnership programs for large-scale sequestration demonstration projects. Other relevant provisions include provisions that would require actions from the Council on Environmental Quality, such as publishing guidance and submitting reports to Congress on CCS research and development. The cost of constructing and operating a new CCS system or retrofitting an existing facility, such as a coal-fired power plant, with CCS is likely to play a major role in the future deployment of commercially viable sequestration projects. Costs for large-scale geologic sequestration or EOR include expenses directly related to injection and storage, as well as costs of investing in sufficient carbon capture and transportation infrastructure and maintaining ongoing facility operations. Regarding regulatory costs associated with geologic sequestration, in the preamble to the Class VI rule, EPA specified the agency's intention that the rule would not impede geologic sequestration: Should this rule somehow impede GS from happening, then the opportunity costs of not capturing with the benefits associated with GS could be attributed to this regulation; however the Agency has tried to develop a rule that balances risk with practicability, site specific flexibility and economic considerations and believes the probability of such impedance is low. Analysts expect that the costs of CCS, whether new system or retrofitting of an existing facility, are likely to total several billion dollars per project, which could act as a barrier to future CCS deployment without the continuation of subsidies. Recently, Public Service Company of New Mexico reportedly estimated that retrofitting a 500-megawatt coal-fired power plant with CCS technology could cost between $5 billion and $6 billion. The company reportedly stated that its evaluations showed that it would be more cost effective to switch to another source of energy (such as renewable energy) rather than continue to use coal with the addition of CCS. Examples of completed commercial-scale CCS operations and associated costs are limited, causing some uncertainty regarding future investments and the scale of project deployment in the coming decades. In a 2019 report, NETL indicated that \"the potential costs of commercial-scale CCS are still not fully understood, particularly from a fully integrated (capture, transportation, and storage) perspective.\" Costs could vary greatly due to a variety of site-specific factors. The type of capture technology is the largest component of costs, possibly accounting for as much as 80% of the total. The variations in the geology of storage formations also make predicting future geologic sequestration costs particularly difficult. Projects that inject some or all the CO 2 for EOR (with incidental carbon storage) involve different cost implications and economic factors from projects injecting solely for permanent CO 2 sequestration. These factors could influence future deployment of these types of projects, as facility owners and operators may consider cost implications when deciding whether to invest in EOR or when deciding between investing projects for EOR or permanent geologic sequestration. EOR operations typically use the existing injection infrastructure in place from earlier oil and gas production activities. Thus, the well exploration and construction costs are \"sunk costs.\" Unlike geologic sequestration projects, these expenses may not be included in total project cost calculations, resulting in comparatively lower costs for injecting and storing the CO 2 . In addition, for EOR projects, overall project costs could be influenced by revenue for the owner or operator from additional oil and gas production. EOR project costs may also be subject to variability and uncertainty, however. NETL notes that the price of oil and the cost and availability of CO 2 are key drivers in the economics of CO 2 EOR. Federal tax credits for carbon storage, available since 2009 for both EOR and geologic sequestration, may also play a role in underground injection and storage of CO 2 project costs and investment decisions . These credits are discussed later in this report. In the preamble to the proposed Class VI rule, EPA noted that \"GS of CO 2 is a new technology that is unfamiliar to most people, and maximizing the public's understanding of the technology can result in more meaningful public input and constructive participation as new GS projects are proposed and developed.\" EPA also stated that \"the agency expects that there will be higher levels of public interest in GS projects than for other injection activities.\" In the Class VI rule, EPA adopted the existing UIC public participation requirements, which require permitting authorities to provide public notice of pending actions, hold public hearings if requested, solicit and respond to public comments, and involve a broad range of stakeholders. At least two cases involving Class VI permits have come before EPA's Environmental Appeals Board. The first case involved the permit for the FutureGen facility, which was never constructed. The second case involved ADM's Illinois facility, currently operating and permitted in Illinois. Public concerns centered on safety and environmental protection issues, including air quality, groundwater quality, and protection of endangered species. Local landowners claimed that the permits do not adequately address how the facility will ensure these protections in the event of leakage or well failure. They also raised concerns about property rights (including mineral rights), potential decreases in property value, and increased traffic associated with the facilities. In the EPAct in 2005 and EISA in 2007, Congress recognized connections between geologic sequestration of CO 2 and the continued use of fossil fuel as a major source of electricity in the United States. Consistent with Congress's directives, DOE's CCS research identifies that the purpose of its CCS research, technology development, and testing is \"to benefit the existing and future fleet of fossil fuel power generating facilities by creating tools to increase our understanding of geologic reservoirs appropriate for CO 2 storage and the behavior of CO 2 in the subsurface.\" In the preamble to the proposed Class VI rule, EPA stated that, \"the capture and storage of CO 2 would enable the continued use of coal in a manner that greatly reduces the associated CO 2 emissions while other safe and affordable energy sources are developed in the coming decades.\" Some stakeholders have argued for further research, development and deployment of CCS (when coupled with negative carbon technology, such as direct air capture) as a method for achieving the negative emissions trajectories modeled by the IPCC. Some of these stakeholders state that CCS is an appropriate transitional technology to reduce CO 2 emissions from electricity generation and other industrial sources while expanding the capacity of low or zero-carbon power sources, such as renewable energy. In contrast, other stakeholders have argued that CO 2 sequestration could create a disincentive to reduce fossil-fuel-based power plant emissions or shift to renewable energy sources. In particular, some stakeholders note that injecting CO 2 for EOR may actually increase net GHG emissions, as it produces additional oil and gas to be burned as fuel. CCS systems also require energy to compress, transport, and inject the CO 2 , which, if derived from fossil fuel combustion, could detract from the net GHG reduc tion benefits of sequestration. Federal tax credits for carbon storage were first enacted in 2008 by the Energy Improvement and Extension Act ( P.L. 110-343 ). This act added Section 45Q to the Internal Revenue Code, which established tax credits for CO 2 storage through both EOR and geologic sequestration. For EOR, only the CO 2 that is used as tertiary injectant and remains in the reservoir qualifies for the tax credit. CO 2 recaptured or recycled does not qualify. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (BBA) amended Section 45Q to increase the amount of these tax credits from $22.66 to $50 per ton over time for sequestered CO 2 and from $12.83 to $35 per ton over time for CO 2 used in EOR. The BBA also removed a 75-million-ton cap on total qualified CO 2 captured or injected but required the relevant taxpayer to claim the credit over a 12-year period after operations begin. Additionally, eligible facilities must be operating or must begin construction before 2024. The U.S. Department of the Treasury is currently considering comments on proposed implementing regulations for the BBA tax credit provision and has not released a final rule. In response to the 2019 Internal Revenue Service notice requesting comments on carbon credits for future regulations and guidance, some oil and gas industry commenters expressed concerns with Treasury's proposed approach to measuring \"secure geological storage\" and other requirements, which they assert would impact their ability to plan and invest in CCS projects. In the meantime, the tax credit as authorized in the BBA is available to qualified entities. Treasury estimates that in FY2019, the credit will reduce federal income tax revenue by $70 million. Over the FY2020-FY2029 budget window, Treasury estimates that the tax credit will reduce federal income tax revenue by a total of $2.3 billion. As of May 2019, the amount of stored carbon oxide claimed for 45Q credits since 2011 totaled 62,740,171 tons. In legislation pending in the 116 th Congress, H.R. 5156 would extend the deadline for the start of construction of a qualified facility to January 1, 2025. S. 2263 would revise the requirements for the secure geologic storage of carbon oxide for EOR and sequestration. Table 2 , below, lists legislation introduced in the 116 th Congress that includes provisions relating to geologic sequestration of CO 2 (as of date of report publication). Legislation in the 116 th Congress has focused on research and development of CCS, including carbon storage through EOR and geologic sequestration, and adjustments to the 45Q carbon storage tax credit.

    "human_reference": "For several decades the federal government has funded efforts to explore the feasibility of mitigating the release of greenhouse gases (GHGs) while burning fossil fuels as a source of energy. Carbon capture and storage (CCS)\u00e2\u0080\u0094the process of capturing manmade carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) at its source, such as a coal-fired power plant, and storing it before its release into the atmosphere\u00e2\u0080\u0094has been proposed as a technological solution for mitigating emissions into the atmosphere while continuing to use fossil energy. Underground carbon storage, known as geologic sequestration, is the long-term containment of a fluid (including gas or liquid CO 2 in subsurface geologic formations). Long-term storage of CO 2 can also occur incidentally through enhanced oil recovery (EOR), a process of injecting CO 2 into an oil or gas reservoir that can significantly increase the amount of oil or gas produced. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) leads the federal government's carbon storage research and development (R&D) as part of the agency's fossil energy programs. The agency conducts research on geologic sequestration and EOR, and carries out the Regional Carbon Sequestration Partnerships (RCSP) program\u00e2\u0080\u0094a set of public-private partnerships across the United States to deploy testing and development of CO 2 injection and storage. To date in the United States, nine projects have injected large volumes of CO 2 into underground formations as demonstrations of potential commercial-scale storage. Four of these projects are actively injecting and storing CO 2 \u00e2\u0080\u0094one in an underground saline reservoir to demonstrate geologic sequestration and three in oil and gas reservoirs as part of EOR. Currently, while numerous large-scale storage R&D projects are ongoing in the United States, none of the projects injecting CO 2 solely for geologic sequestration are operating in a commercial capacity. The Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA), administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), provides authorities for regulating underground injection of fluids and serves as the framework for regulation of geologic sequestration of CO 2 and EOR. The major purpose of the act's Underground Injection Control (UIC) provisions is to prevent endangerment of underground sources of drinking water from injection activities. EPA has promulgated regulations and established minimum federal requirements for six classes of injection wells. In 2010, EPA promulgated regulations for the underground injection of CO 2 for long-term storage and established UIC Class VI, a new class of wells solely for geologic sequestration of CO 2 . The well performance standards and other requirements established in the Class VI rule are based on the distinctive features of CO 2 injection compared to other types of injection. Two Class VI wells, both in Illinois, are currently permitted by EPA in the United States. No state has issued a permit for a Class VI well. CO 2 injection for EOR is conducted using Class II wells (associated with oil and gas production). SDWA also authorizes states to administer UIC programs in lieu of EPA, known as primacy . For Class VI CO 2 geologic sequestration wells, only North Dakota has primacy. Most oil and gas producing states have primacy for Class II wells and regulate these wells under their own state programs. Congress has supported carbon storage via underground injection through recent legislation directing DOE to expand R&D activity and increasing the federal tax credit for underground carbon storage. A policy challenge that Congress may face with underground carbon storage is balancing protection of underground sources of drinking water with supporting and encouraging the development of cost-effective CCS technology. If Congress were to explore future policy in this area, Members may consider the potential health and environmental risks (beyond any related risks to underground sources of drinking water) not addressed by SDWA. Other issues for Congress include unresolved liability and property rights issues, overall CCS project cost, public acceptance of these sequestration projects and participation in their planning, and the relationship of the growth of underground carbon storage with continuing to burn fossil fuels for generating electricity.",

( 2 ) ps causes a mediastinal shift leading to an underestimation of lhr , thus distorting the prognosis that seems poorer.7 \n  prenatal identification of both cdh and ps is possible , and frequently occurs.7 in our case , prenatal diagnosis of concurrent cdh and ps was not possible probably because herniated organs obscured the presence of a sequestered lung mass . the treatment of choice of a symptomatic eps in addition to a cdh is surgical excision.1 \n 2 however , some authors recommend observation of asymptomatic eps , as these lesions rarely produce complications.12 we believe that resection should be the treatment of choice in all cases since there are hybrid lesions misdiagnosed as pure sequestrations and one can never be sure that the lesion will remain asymptomatic.4 the most frequent argumentation for removal is the prevention of recurrent infections and malignancy . malignancy has been reported to be associated to cystic lesions , in particular to type i congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation in 1% of cases.12 although the risk is quite low , in case of recurrent infections or neoplastic evolution , the previous  wait and see  approach would be difficult to justify . regarding the surgical approach , minimally invasive alternatives to the traditional surgical technique have been recently proposed , although the best approach to cdh is controversial.2 recently , hypercapnia and acidosis during thoracoscopy in newborns have been reported.13 \n 14 in our case , we used co2 insufflation at the beginning of the procedure to facilitate reduction of herniated organs only for brief periods to improve visibility . the distinction between a diaphragmatic hernia with sac and a congenital localized eventration may be difficult . sac removal seems to be associated with a lower recurrence rate,15 but during thoracoscopy the presence of a sac can facilitate reduction , can lessen visceral trauma , and keeps the two cavities separate.2 according to a recent survey among the international pediatric endosurgery group members,16 22% of surgeons declared to leave the sac in place during the thoracoscopic repair of cdh , so this approach is quite accepted even if in a minority of cases . accurate closure of this vessel is mandatory to avoid postoperative bleeding , which can be life - threatening.17 in case of eps , vessel sealing can be achieved with different devices such as ligasure , clips , and ligation . in this case , since the eps was of limited size , we closed the feeding artery with two endoloops and cut the vessel with cold scissors to avoid thermic damage of the ligatures . we would probably have missed the ps using a different surgical approach ( classical laparotomy ) , as during the laparotomic approach the posterior position of the diaphragmatic defect makes it hard to inspect the entire hypoplastic lung that is atelectatic and displaced in the upper part of the chest . the thoracoscopic approach for cdh offers the advantage to easily diagnose and treat associated lung lesions . the case report describes the usefulness of thoracoscopy as diagnostic and therapeutic tool in case of diaphragmatic hernia associated with undiagnosed lung malformation . thoracoscopy allows to explore thoracic cavity looking for lung lesions that are associated to diaphragmatic hernia in 1540% of cases and to remove them .",

    "document": "EU leaders have agreed a package of measures to tackle the escalating migrant crisis in the Mediterranean \u2013 with pledges to send in warships and triple funding for rescue patrols. After years of dithering, an emergency EU summit yesterday agreed to lay the groundwork for military action against traffickers after the deaths of some 1,700 refugees in the last week alone. Within days, British warship\u00a0HMS Bulwark and the German supply ship Berlin are expected to be sent to the region in the biggest sign of the European Union's belated commitment to the cause. Prime Minister David Cameron, who is two weeks from a national election in which immigration is a major issue, stressed that Britain was not planning to bring any more migrants back to the UK. Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, whose country has been faced with almost daily tragedy as rescuers pluck bodies from the sea, called the EU measures 'a giant step forward.' But other EU leaders were less optimistic, with Malta's prime minister, Joseph Muscat, saying the assets being proposed would 'never be enough' to address the problem. 'A giant step forward': Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi speaks after EU leaders agreed a package of measures to tackle the growing migrant crisis including extra military and a tripling of funding for patrols . Jovial: Danish Prime minister Helle Thorning Schmidt and her British counterpart David Cameron embrace before posing for a family photo during a European Union leaders summit in Brussels . The pledge of resources came as victims of the worst-ever migrant disaster in the Mediterranean were buried Thursday in Malta. Two dozen wooden caskets containing the only bodies recovered from a weekend capsizing off Libya that left at least 800 migrants feared dead were laid out for a memorial service. None of the bodies was identified: One casket had 'No 132' scrawled on it, referring to the number of the DNA sample taken from the corpse in case a relative ever comes to claim it. For several years as death tolls mounted, EU leaders have done little more than deplore the loss of lives and mark tragedies with moments of silence and wreaths instead of fundamental action. When Libya disintegrated politically after the overthrow of longtime leader Muammar Gaddafi and unrest spread in neighboring countries, Europe failed to take forceful action. Yesterday, EU leaders pledged to do more, committing at least nine vessels to monitor the waters for traffickers and intervene in case of need. Other member states, from France to Latvia, also lined up more ships, planes and helicopters that could be used to rescue migrants. The member states agreed to triple funding to \u20ac9million (\u00a37m) a month for the EU's border operation that patrols the Mediterranean. Seek and destroy: Britain will send one of its biggest warships, HMS Bulwark (above), to the Mediterranean within days as part of plans to targets boats used by human traffickers . Escalating crisis: A migrant is stretchered off to hospital by the Italian Red Cross at the port of Salerno after being rescued by the tanker Chimera along with 545 other refugees in the Mediterranean . They also assigned EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini to line up the diplomatic options that would allow EU militaries to strike against the boats used by traffickers. Officials said the lack of a strong Libyan government would likely make UN backing necessary. 'Leaders have already pledged significantly greater support, including many more vessels, aircraft and experts' than had been anticipated before the summit, EU President Donald Tusk said. Despite the sudden deluge of goodwill, huge questions remained about whether it would be enough to defeat the smugglers and human traffickers. 'Right now, it's a question of fixing yesterday's errors,' French President Francois Hollande said. He said the EU would hold a summit in Malta with African countries by this summer to see how the continents can work together to better deal with a crisis that has grown dramatically in recent years. In contrast to the Italian premier, the head of another Mediterranean nation on the frontline of the tragedies was far less enthusiastic. For tiny Malta, the smallest EU member state with a population of 450,000, the summit produced nothing particularly new, apart from a fresh resolve to break up the smuggling networks. The assets being proposed 'will never be enough,' Malta's prime minister, Joseph Muscat said. 'It is definitely not enough if the numbers that are being communicated about prospective migratory flows are anything to go by.' On the offensive: EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini (pictured) has been assigned to line up the diplomatic options that would allow EU militaries to strike against the boats used by traffickers . In the past week alone, more than 10,000 people have been plucked from the seas between Italy and Libya as desperate migrants fleeing war and poverty threw their lot in with smugglers who charged up to $2,000 for a spot on overcrowded boats to make the perilous crossing. At least 1,300 people have died in April alone, putting 2015 on track to be the deadliest year ever. Ending that is Europe's main challenge. Even optimists say any measures agreed at Thursday's summit would not fully stem the tide of unstable ships crossing the Mediterranean. But Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte insisted that Europe should not take the brunt of blame. 'We also ask that Africa, the source of the problem, also collectively takes up its responsibility,' Rutte said. 'Last time I checked Libya was in Africa, not Europe.' German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande arrive at an EU emergency summit in Brussels seeking a solution to the migrants crisis . Over the past year, what little political structure Libya had has collapsed. There are two rival governments, neither with any real authority, and each fighting the other on the ground. Local militias hold sway around the country, some of them with hard-line Islamist ideologies, and the Islamic State group has emerged as a strong and brutal force. The makes any military action against traffickers there even more complicated. 'Any kind of military action can only be based on international law,' said German Chancellor Angela Merkel. 'There are two possibilities: either a U.N. Security Council Resolution or a unity government in Libya. We have neither at the moment.' Europe itself was hardly a picture of unity when it came to the difficult issue of resettling migrants. Countries like Germany, Sweden, France and Italy have dealt with a disproportionate number of asylum requests while many eastern and Baltic member states take hardly any. Five of the 28 member states are handling almost 70 per cent of the migrants coming in. Still, despite the differences, Finland's prime minister Alexander Stubb was hopeful that this time Europe could put up a show of solidarity. 'I hope we'll get it right this time,' he said.",

    "document": "TAPPER: Welcome back to THE LEAD. Continuing our World Lead, of course, the new information that we've received today indicating that missing Malaysia Airline flight 370 traveled about an hour off course after its transponder stopped transmitting, well, it took four days for that information to emerge from a senior Malaysian air force official. In a world where every move we make is tracked by someone or another, how is it possible that technology hasn't been able to locate this plane yet? Let's bring in Noah Shactman. He's executive editor at \"The Daily Beast.\" He's also a nonresident fellow at the Brookings Institute's Center for 21st Century Security and Intelligence. Noah, thanks so much for joining us. After four days, we're now being told that a military radar picked up the plane an hour after initial reports that contact was lost. What is different about a military radar versus a civilian aviation radar?</s>NOAH SHACTMAN, EXECUTIVE EDITOR, THE DAILY BEAST: Sure. And thanks for having me, Jake. Military radars are of course more powerful than their civilian counterparts. And they can also, depending on the model, can also sort of see through the brine of the sea and can look lower than civilian radar can. They are also differently positioned. So, we're now getting hit on this military radar from the Straits of Malacca. That's a well-known piracy hub, and there's been counter-piracy activities by the Malaysian military and others for more than a decade there. So in a sense, if they found the plane over the Straits of Malacca, it makes sense that the military would find it and not the civilian authorities.</s>TAPPER: What about the black boxes? What are crews doing to find that?</s>SHACTMAN: You know, the black boxes, which are actually orange, do have a beacon on them. But the thing is that those beacons can only call out for about five miles or so. So it's still very, very, very hard to find these things in the open ocean. It's really - it's the smallest of needles in the biggest of haystacks.</s>TAPPER: Assuming that the plane is more than five miles underwater, you're saying?</s>SHACTMAN: No, I'm saying that gives you a five mile radius to look in. But look, they just found this thing hundreds of miles off course, so who knows where it is. So it helps, but it only helps to a certain degree.</s>TAPPER: So we've heard that forces from 10 different countries are scouring the region. What are they carrying on their aircraft and ships to try to find this plane?</s>SHACTMAN: Yes, that's right. Forces from the Chinese military, the Malaysian, of course, the American military, the Australians, the Thai, the Vietnamese on and on are all looking for this thing. It's really an incredible hunt. And the U.S. military in particular is kind of treating it like \"The Hunt For Red October.\" They are using some of the most sophisticated sub hunting equipment, magnotometers to look for metal. They are using acoustic sensors to hear if the plane might still be moving. Infrared, regular optical sensors, satellites. It's really an impressive array and, unfortunately, they still haven't been able to find anything, despite all of that gear.</s>TAPPER: Are we sure that the most advanced technology is being used? What are some of the other ones that searchers may be employing?</s>SHACTMAN: Well, it really seems like they are throwing just about everything at it, even the array of sensors used to detect nuclear launches. Those sensors are being used. They are called infrasound. They look for very low sound waves -- are being used. It's really kind of everything. And, still, they have no luck. It's amazing.</s>TAPPER: This may sound like a strange question, but after the Boston Marathon bombing, there was a lot of crowd sourcing. Now, a lot of that information was proved to be incorrect, but some of it was proven correct. Considering all of the satellite technology and things that the people at home have access to, is there any way for people who want to help the search who are sitting at home and maybe are advanced with their computers, is there anything that they can do?</s>SHACTMAN: Actually, it's not such a crazy question. Digital Globe, which is the leading commercial satellite imaging company, they provide a lot of the online maps, they provide images to the U.S. military, they've opened up their archives for the public to go and scour to see if they find anything. Now, at the moment, that public facing website is down, but I'm told that it should be up shortly and, yes, maybe there is something in that wide open ocean that can be found by you and me.</s>TAPPER: Just the idea of all of that data and bringing more eyes to it maybe could help find this airplane. Noah Shactman, thank you so much. We appreciate your time. Coming up, thanks but no thanks. Why Secretary of State John Kerry is refusing a sit-down meeting with Vladimir Putin. That's next. Plus, a daughter begging her father to come home safely. A mother holding out hope her son will return. The heartbreaking stories of families desperate for answers. Coming up.",

Indeed, archaeologists have been known to find the remains of bodies clutching make-up, beauty tools in graves and detailed beauty manuals from bygone times. While they may not have had vampire facials, cellulite cream and contouring kits at their disposal, the women of ancient history had some fascinating methods for beautifying themselves. The women of ancient history, including Mary Queen of Scots, who washed herself in white wine, had some fascinating methods for beautifying themselves . Cleopatra, for one, had some interesting methods and even penned a book documenting her most prized beauty secrets. The famed Egyptian beauty famously bathed in\u00a0donkey-milk baths. Her daily donkey-milk baths, which she believed had anti-ageing and skin smoothing properties thanks to the alpha hydroxy acids, apparently required over 700 donkeys to accomplish. She often mixed donkey-milk with crocodile dung to create a face mask and also bathed in rose petals to leave her skin smelling sweet. Egyptian queen Nefertiti, meanwhile, loved to make her own cosmetics, including her own blend of eyeliner using lead-based kohl, and clay and crushed beetles as blusher. Cleopatra, left, the famed Egyptian beauty, famously bathed in donkey-milk baths, while\u00a0Empress Elisabeth of Austria, right, loved to conjure up her own face creams in the 19th century . The goddesses of Ancient Greece strove to achieve a pale complexion and made honey and olive oil-based concoctions to achieve this. They used a combination of white lead and olive oil to whiten the skin and created an on-trend monobrow using dark powder. Bleach blonde hair was coveted in Ancient Greece and women doused themselves in vinegar to get the look. Meanwhile, the ladies of ancient India used cow dung and urine to boost their beauty regime and were said to treat problem skin and cracked heels using the bizarre ingredient. A rouge pout came courtesy of betel leaves, which  women would chomp on. The Geishas of Japan used rice flour to whiten their faces and cleansed with nightingale poop . The Geishas of Japan - particularly in the Heian era - achieved black teeth with oxidised iron fillings steeped in an acidic solution. Faces were whitened using rice flour and removed using nightingale poop, a treatment that beauty salons are adding to their menus today. Over in China, female emperor Wu Zetian mixed Chinese motherwort with cold water to cleanse her face. Mary, Queen of Scots was said to wash her body in white wine, which, thanks to its antiseptic alcohol content, was deemed to help boost her complexion. Empress Elisabeth (Sisi) of Austria loved to conjure up her own face creams in the 19th century. She mixed spermaceti (a wax found in the head of sperm whales), rosewater and almond oil and coated her face with the substance daily. She was also fond of creating a DIY night mask using raw veal and crushed strawberries.",

intuitive surgical , sunnydale , usa ) in arm 1 , a monopolar cautery hook ( endowrist monopolar cautery instrument ; intuitive surgical , sunnydale , usa ) to dissect structures in arm 2 and the camera ( 3d vision system 12 mm 30 endoscope ; intuitive surgical , sunnydale , usa ) in arm 3 . after full exposure of the kidney and vascular structures , a pfannenstiel incision was made and an endo - bag ( endocatch ; us surgical , norwalk , usa ) was introduced into the abdomen . subsequently , the ureter was clipped and divided with scissors , and the renal artery and the vein were transected using an endoscopic stapler ( endogia ; us surgical , norwalk , usa ) . the kidney was then placed in the endobag and extracted through the pfannenstiel incision . before removing all trocars , the renal bed and vascular stumps were inspected using the da vinci , and intra - abdominal hemostasis was performed with the fenestrated bipolar forceps . the operation field was found to be dry after which all incisions were closed intracutaneously . postoperatively , the patient was placed on dipidolor patient - controlled analgesia combined with paracetamol . during the postoperative recovery she was discharged at postoperative day 3 with a normal appetite and no wound problems . on postoperative day 11 , she visited the outpatient clinic for a follow - up visit and the nausea was completely gone . however , she noted abdominal pain located on the right side near the iliac crest and reported two episodes of hematuria . laboratory results showed a decreased c - reactive protein ( crp ) level and normal leukocyte count . on postoperative day 19 , the patient noted bright red fluid leakage from the pfannenstiel incision without any further symptoms and contacted the nurse practioner . it was decided that she would visit the outpatient clinic if the leakage would worsen or other complaints would emerge . on postoperative day 29 , the patient visited the outpatient clinic for her scheduled 1-month postoperative follow - up visit . she still experienced pain in her abdomen which was mildly controlled with anti - analgesia . the pain progressed when she laid on her right or left side and , at night , her abdomen was more distended than usual . on physical examination , she had a distended abdomen , with tenderness on palpation on the right and the left side , and below the umbilicus , with a shifting dullness on percussion during movement . an abdominal ultrasonography showed intraperitoneal fluid in all four quadrants of the abdomen and a diagnostic paracentesis demonstrated yellow fluid with a lipid aspect , suspected of being chylous ascites and confirmed by biochemical analysis showing positive triglycerides of 57.98 mmol / l . she was admitted to the hospital for drainage and a medium - chain triglyceride - based diet was started . on day 4 the medium - chain triglyceride - based diet was continued for a total of 4 weeks after which a second abdominal ultrasonography was done , which showed no fluid in the abdomen . in this case report , we describe the first reported complication of chylous ascites after total robot - assisted donor nephrectomy . this complication is more common in major oncological surgical procedures , where lymph nodes are often resected . therefore , from an oncological point of view these patients often casually accept this complication . nevertheless , healthy live kidney donors are different from patients who undergo extensive dissection damaging lymphatic vessels necessitating postoperative treatment . in over three decades , > 1500 live donor nephrectomies have been performed at our centre and never before have we encountered a case of postoperative chylous ascites after a donor nephrectomy . a review of the literature resulted in a total of 56 reported cases of chylous ascites after donor nephrectomy ( supplement 1 ) . a huge contrast has been compared with the thousands of live donor nephrectomies that have been published over the years . the occurrence of chylous ascites is low and the expectation is that this is an underestimation . there is no clear treatment pathway ;

    "document": "Drawback refunds are a remittance of up to 99 percent of duties, taxes, or fees previously paid by an importer. CBP makes these refunds on imported goods on which the importer previously paid duties, taxes, or fees, and subsequently exported from the United States or destroyed. (See fig. 1.) According to CBP, the rationale for the drawback program was to encourage American commerce and manufacturing. It permits American manufacturers to compete in foreign markets without the handicap of including in their costs, and consequently in their sales price, the duty they paid on imported merchandise. Claimants can apply for and obtain the privilege of accelerated payment of drawback refunds. Accelerated payment allows estimated drawback refunds to be paid prior to liquidation of the drawback entry, provided that, among other things, claimants have acquired and posted with CBP a bond in an amount sufficient to cover the estimated amount of drawback to be claimed. There are three main categories of drawback refunds: (1) manufacturing drawback (direct identification and substitution), (2) unused merchandise drawback (direct identification and substitution), and (3) rejected merchandise drawback. Within each category, there are variations in drawback eligibility, such as the ability to substitute imported merchandise. a. Direct identification manufacturing drawback may be claimed on exported or destroyed articles that have been manufactured or produced in the United States with imported duty-paid merchandise, if those articles have not been used in the United States prior to export or destruction under CBP supervision. For example, a claimant could claim a drawback refund on exported pants made in the United States using imported foreign fabric. (See fig. 2.) b. Substitution manufacturing drawback may be claimed on exported or destroyed articles that have been manufactured or produced in the United States using domestic merchandise substituted for imported duty-paid merchandise meeting the statutory criteria, where the articles have not been used in the United States. As a result, domestic producers can select the most advantageous sources for their raw materials and components without regard to duties, saving them production costs. For example, a claimant could claim a drawback refund on exported pants made in the United States using domestic fabric substituted for imported foreign fabric. (See fig. 3.) a. Direct identification unused merchandise drawback may be claimed on imported merchandise that was exported or destroyed under CBP supervision, without having been used within the United States. For example, a claimant could claim a drawback refund on unused imported designer dresses upon their destruction. (See fig. 4.) b. Substitution unused merchandise drawback may be claimed on goods that were exported or destroyed under CBP supervision, without being used, and were substituted for imported merchandise meeting the appropriate criteria. For example, a claimant could claim a drawback refund on exported cars substituted for imported foreign-made cars. (See fig. 5.) 3. Rejected merchandise drawback may be claimed upon the exportation or destruction under CBP supervision of imported duty- paid merchandise entered or withdrawn for consumption, provided it meets the statutory criteria (i.e., not conforming to sample or specifications, shipped without consent, determined to be defective at the time of import, or ultimately sold at retail and returned). For example, a claimant could claim a drawback refund on foreign fabric it imported but returned to the seller because the fabric did not conform to the specification of the claimant\u2019s order. (See fig. 6.) During calendar years 2009 through August 21, 2019, the total amount of drawback refunds claimed ranged from $631.6 million to $1.4 billion. The amount of drawback refunds claimed varied from year to year, but generally rose between 2011 and 2016. Overall, in dollar terms, substitution unused merchandise drawback remained the largest category of drawback refund, as shown in table 1. As originally enacted in 1789, the drawback program was limited to duties paid on certain imported merchandise if the merchandise was exported within a year. In the 1930s, drawback claimants could use substituted merchandise for imported merchandise in specified circumstances. Congress has continued to allow substitution for drawback refunds in various forms. (See fig. 7.) The U.S. International Trade Commission publishes and maintains the HTS. The HTS is used to determine tariff classifications for goods imported into the United States. Each item imported into the United States is classified in a category with an assigned 8-digit HTS subheading number. The category may be subdivided into 10-digit HTS subheading numbers for statistical purposes. The 4-digit and 6-digit nomenclature is consistent internationally. CBP is responsible for fixing the final classification. For unused merchandise substitution drawback claims, TFTEA also allows drawback using the U.S. Department of Commerce Schedule B commodity number. Pub. L. No. 114-125, \u00a7 906(e)(4). We do not discuss the use of the Schedule B commodity number in this report because, according to CBP, it is very rare that the Schedule B commodity number is not identical to the HTS number. stating that importers are now jointly and severally liable with claimants for refunds associated with their imported goods. Treasury and CBP had 2 years from the date of enactment of TFTEA to promulgate regulations implementing the TFTEA drawback provisions. TFTEA also provided for an additional 1-year transition period (February 24, 2018\u2013February 23, 2019) during which drawback claimants could file under either the amended provisions or the drawback law as it previously existed. When the government did not meet the 2-year deadline for issuing regulations, which lapsed on February 24, 2018, a number of companies filed suit. Subsequently, Treasury and CBP published the Modernized Drawback Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in the Federal Register on August 2, 2018 and separately published the Regulatory Impact Analysis of the Modernized Drawback Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. In an October 12, 2018 order, the Court of International Trade ordered the United States to file the final rule developed pursuant to the Modernized Drawback Notice of Proposed Rulemaking with the Office of the Federal Register by December 17, 2018. The government met that deadline, publishing the Modernized Drawback Final Rule in the Federal Register and the Regulatory Impact Analysis of the Modernized Drawback Final Rule (RIA). In the final rule, CBP summarized and responded to public comments received on the Modernized Drawback Notice of Proposed Rulemaking and established new policies and procedures for the drawback program pursuant to TFTEA. In the RIA, CBP provided its predictions of the impact\u2014primarily in terms of costs, benefits, and revenue transfers\u2014of key changes to the drawback program on industry and the U.S. government. CBP did not make accelerated payments on or liquidate any TFTEA drawback claims until the final rule was issued. CBP also did not make any drawback payments during the partial federal government shutdown (December 22, 2018\u2013 January 25, 2019). Under drawback modernization, CBP transitioned its filing process for making claims for payment under the drawback program from its Automated Commercial System (ACS) to its Automated Commercial Environment (ACE). Previously, CBP required claimants to file a paper claim, and electronic transmission of a claim summary through ACS was optional. TFTEA required claimants to file all claims electronically on and after February 24, 2018, but also allowed for a 1-year transition period where claims could be filed under the existing drawback statute or under the statute as amended by TFTEA. CBP designated ACE as the electronic system for filing drawback claims. CBP initially partially deployed ACE for the drawback program on February 24, 2018, to allow electronic filing of claims. During the transition period, claimants could file claims under the existing drawback process (detailed in 19 C.F.R. part 191) or under the new drawback process (detailed in 19 C.F.R. part 190). CBP fully deployed ACE for the drawback program on February 24, 2019, the first day after the transition period when all drawback claims had to be filed under the amended statute and implementing regulations. After CBP mandated electronic filing in ACE, drawback entry summary data had to be filed at the more detailed line item level. ACE has expanded capabilities, such as accounting for line item reporting for drawback claims and automatically validating drawback claims against underlying import entries. Changes in the broader trade policy context may also impact CBP\u2019s drawback program. In particular, 2018 witnessed a series of presidential and agency actions that resulted in higher tariffs on a range of goods. For example, in January 2018, the President issued Presidential Proclamation 9693 and Presidential Proclamation 9694, imposing tariff rate quotas and increased duties on imports of solar cells and panels, and washing machines and parts, effective February 7, 2018. Further, at the direction of the President, the United States Trade Representative has imposed additional duties on products of China in four tranches, in June 2018, August 2018, September 2018, and August 2019. According to the United States Trade Representative request for comments on a modification to the fourth tranche, the four tranches cover an annual aggregate trade value of approximately $550 billion. CBP has determined that the aforementioned tariffs (commonly referred to as section 201 and 301 duties, respectively) are eligible for drawback refunds and issued guidance on how to make such claims. For fiscal year 2019, Treasury reported that it collected $70.8 billion in customs duties, as compared to $41.3 billion in fiscal year 2018. Within the Department of Homeland Security, CBP\u2019s Office of Trade is primarily responsible for managing the drawback program. CBP officials described the roles and responsibilities of the several offices within CBP that are involved, as follows: Trade Policy and Programs. The Office of Trade Policy and Programs provides policy and program oversight for the drawback program. Field Operations. The Office of Field Operations is responsible for implementing the drawback program, including ensuring that the Drawback Centers have the resources\u2014allocations, staffing, equipment\u2014to perform their duties and meet CBP\u2019s trade mission. Drawback Centers. Drawback specialists located in one of the four Drawback Centers in Chicago, Houston, Newark, or San Francisco are responsible for reviewing and processing drawback claims. They review claims, in whole or in part, to determine eligibility for drawback refunds. (Appendix II describes CBP\u2019s steps for filing and processing drawback claims.) They also review and make determinations concerning claimants\u2019 (1) requests for drawback privileges for accelerated payment and waiver of prior notice, (2) applications for certain manufacturing rulings, and (3) protests of denied claims. Regulations and Rulings. The Office of Regulations and Rulings is responsible for issuing various types of binding rulings and decisions on drawback refunds. These include decisions on protest applications flagged for further review by the Drawback Centers as well as prospective ruling requests filed by drawback applicants, such as rulings on specific manufacturing drawback rulings and on the proper classification of merchandise for substitution manufacturing drawback. In addition to issuing binding rulings, the Office of Regulations and Rulings is responsible for drafting any regulatory changes involving the drawback program and provides technical advice for drawback policy and litigation. TFTEA generally expanded eligibility for drawback refunds, with some caveats, but CBP is not adequately managing its growing workload of claims resulting from the changes. The substitution standard for drawback claims under TFTEA generally allowed more merchandise to potentially qualify for drawback refunds. However, it also limited the eligibility of certain broadly categorized merchandise. TFTEA also expanded the scope of the refund of taxes and fees for manufacturing claims and standardized time limits to file claims. On balance, these changes, along with certain limitations in CBP\u2019s Automated Commercial Environment (ACE), have led to an increase in the workload of drawback specialists. However, CBP did not anticipate the increased workload and does not have a plan to manage the increased workload, which has caused delays resulting in uncertainty for industry\u2014potentially impeding trade. Change of substitution standard: According to CBP officials, the most significant change resulting from TFTEA is that it is now easier to substitute merchandise and still qualify for drawback refunds. TFTEA changed the substitution standard for certain drawback types, with new rules reflecting a shift from a subjective to a more objective standard. Previously, CBP applied a subjective \u2018\u2018same kind and quality\u2019\u2019 standard for manufacturing substitution drawback and \u2018\u2018commercially interchangeable\u2019\u2019 standard for unused merchandise drawback. For example, CBP did not permit a U.S.-based clothing manufacturer, Jockey, to substitute light blue underwear for dark blue underwear for an unused merchandise drawback claim before modernization. In 1995, Jockey submitted a request to CBP for a \u201ccommercially interchangeable\u201d ruling to permit it to substitute underwear that is the same size, style, and specification, but different in color and part number\u2014for example, substitute light blue underwear for dark blue underwear. CBP ruled that Jockey underwear was not \u201ccommercially interchangeable\u201d for the purpose of the unused merchandise substitution drawback. Under the new substitution standard for manufacturing drawback and unused merchandise drawback, both the imported merchandise and the substituted merchandise generally must match at the 8-digit or 10-digit HTS classification to be eligible for drawback refunds. The new substitution standard has made more merchandise eligible for drawback refunds, such as the Jockey underwear that would now be eligible for unused merchandise substitution drawback, as shown in the example for one type of product in figure 8 below. It has also enabled automatic acceptance and verification of drawback claims in ACE. CBP officials told us that they had seen an increase in new claimants as a result of the changes to the substitution standard, among other factors. According to industry representatives we interviewed, the changes to the substitution standard have enabled new companies to file for drawback refunds and have expanded eligibility for existing clients. For example, they stated that the changes to the substitution standard have allowed the automotive industry to substitute domestic car exports for imported foreign-made cars, as mentioned earlier. One industry representative noted that as a result of the new substitution standard, an automotive company that had been recovering about $2 million in drawback refunds per year before TFTEA can now recover about $20 million a year. Drawback trading: The new substitution standard may also broaden the scope for \u201cdrawback trading,\u201d according to industry representatives we interviewed. They described \u201cdrawback trading\u201d as matching excess import and export activity through the use of a third-party special purpose entity that exists for the sole purpose of maximizing drawback refund recovery between currently unrelated importers and exporters with no existing commercial relationship. CBP officials we spoke to did not think the new substitution standard should have any bearing on the potential for \u201cdrawback trading.\u201d CBP officials explained that although the substitution standard for certain drawback claims had changed, TFTEA should not significantly affect \u201cdrawback trading\u201d because, as before TFTEA, the claimant would still need to fulfill the possession and assignment standards. Finished petroleum derivative drawback claims do not have a possession requirement. CBP has permitted drawback where a company set up relationships with the importer and exporter expressly to maximize drawback for finished petroleum derivatives. Limitation of basket provisions from unused merchandise substitution drawback: While TFTEA\u2019s change to the use of HTS classifications generally expanded eligibility for certain drawback substitution claims, it concurrently limited eligibility in certain situations. Specifically, TFTEA prohibited eligibility for unused merchandise substitution of merchandise that is classified as \u201cother\u201d at both the 8-digit and 10-digit HTS subheadings for drawback refunds. Such classifications are considered basket provisions. For example, shrimps and prawns that fall under the HTS 1605.21.10.30 basket provision, as shown in figure 9, are not eligible for substitution unused merchandise drawback, as follows. If the shrimps and prawns are not in airtight containers, and are not products containing fish meat or prepared meals, they fall under \u201cother\u201d at the 8-digit HTS subheading (1605.21.10). If these shrimps and prawns are also frozen but not breaded, they fall under \u201cother\u201d at the 10-digit HTS statistical suffix (1605.21.10.30), categorizing them in a basket provision. According to CBP, the products most affected by the limitation on basket provisions from unused merchandise substitution drawback based solely on 2016 HTS counts will be screws, nuts, and bolts; motor vehicle parts and accessories; and transmission shafts. One company we spoke with had been able to claim over $1 million in unused merchandise substitution drawback a year prior to modernization, for an imported ceramic substrate used for cleaning emissions in cars. The company also makes domestically sourced ceramic substrate, which it exports. CBP considered these two products commercially interchangeable. However, according to the company, the ceramic substrate is classified as a basket provision and the company is no longer eligible for drawback refunds. from the same inventory. If the imported item is substituted for an exported item that is not fungible with the imported item, it does not qualify for direct identification. able to administer the new statistical reporting number. For example, the article description must be clear, the HTS classification must be correct, and the new number must not require difficult or prohibitively expensive laboratory or other testing. If merchandise is not eligible for direct identification drawback but is classified as a basket provision, it may still qualify for a drawback refund if a company can successfully petition the Committee for Statistical Annotation of Tariff Schedules for new 10-digit HTS statistical breakouts. However, such a workaround is time-intensive and not guaranteed, according to an industry representative. In one example, the representative explained that a chemical company with a product classified as a basket provision successfully petitioned for a new statistical breakout. The company produces chemical methanol and was unable to file a TFTEA drawback claim in 2018 because of the basket provision restriction. Such requests are generally considered by the committee twice a year. Standardizing time limits: TFTEA also expanded eligibility for drawback refunds by standardizing the drawback filing deadline. Previously, drawback claim filing deadlines varied based on type of claim and time between import and export or destruction, ranging from 3 years to 5 years from importation to exportation or destruction, followed by a 3-year window to file a claim. TFTEA generally standardized the timelines for the acceptance of claims to be up to 5 years from import. CBP expects the new eligibility time frames will give some drawback claimants more time to file for drawback and potentially increase drawback eligibility for some claimants. Expanding taxes and fees: TFTEA expanded the scope of drawback refunds by explicitly including taxes and fees for manufacturing drawback claims. Prior to TFTEA, the drawback statute did not specify that taxes and fees were eligible for manufacturing drawback. TFTEA extended drawback refunds to taxes and fees for manufacturing claims. Some industry representatives we spoke to told us they were benefiting from this expansion. For example, a representative from the U.S. oil industry noted that the new law is \u201cmuch more lucrative\u201d for oil companies that refine crude oil because they can now get drawback refunds on the oil spill tax and harbor maintenance fee. CBP has not adequately managed the growing workload drawback specialists have been experiencing since TFTEA. Drawback specialists told us that they had been experiencing increasing workloads since CBP implemented the changes from TFTEA. The largest Drawback Centers expect their backlog of old claims will take about 5 years to work through. This workload is the cumulative result of various factors that have caused delays with processing claims, rulings, and privileges applications. The workload of the Drawback Centers is growing because of a learning curve related to the switch from a paper-based to an electronic process, delays in processing claims, and an increase in the number of claims, as discussed below. Further, the Drawback Centers continue to face staffing shortages. Learning curve: According to CBP officials, drawback specialists face a learning curve as they become familiar with ACE and the new rules for drawback refunds. They explained that drawback specialists are still working through pre-TFTEA claims that were migrated into ACE. From January 1, 2019 to September 13, 2019, CBP Drawback Centers liquidated about 18 percent of the value of the remaining claims filed in CBP\u2019s Automated Commercial System (ACS) and about 27 percent of the number of remaining claims filed in ACS. For TFTEA claims, CBP provided in-person training to drawback specialists before the final regulations were issued, as well as in May 2019 and September 2019. CBP has also been updating its guidance for processing claims, and, according to officials, plans to continue to offer trainings for drawback specialists as it finalizes the guidance. Nevertheless, adjusting to the changes has hampered the efficiency of drawback specialists. For example, drawback specialists explained that they had to learn to toggle between different systems that require separate logins to review event history, file uploads, and tax information within ACE in order to fully process a claim. Delays in processing claims: CBP faced a delay in processing drawback claims because of a hold relating to the issuance of the drawback final rule. Claimants could begin filing TFTEA claims on February 24, 2018, but CBP did not process any of these claims pending the final rule\u2014 which CBP issued on December 17, 2018. As a result, all 18,319 claims filed during this 10-month period were put on hold. CBP lifted the hold when the final rule was issued. CBP\u2019s workload continued to grow because certain TFTEA manufacturing claims were on hold. Following TFTEA, the proposed and final rule required claimants who wanted to operate under an existing manufacturing ruling to file a supplemental application for a limited modification to the existing ruling, as previously discussed. According to CBP interim guidance, to ensure compliance with TFTEA drawback requirements, a limited modification must include a bill of materials or formula, annotated with the applicable HTS subheading numbers. Claimants who did not apply for a limited modification by February 23, 2019, would need to apply for a new manufacturing ruling. CBP received about 800 applications for limited modifications, which it began approving on September 16, 2019. Between February 2019 and July 2019, CBP also received about 50 applications for new manufacturing rulings, which it has not yet begun to process. These processes remain paper-based (see fig. 10). CBP officials explained that CBP generally does not process manufacturing drawback claims until claimants are issued up-to-date ruling numbers. Until the new or modified manufacturing rulings are approved, CBP officials explained, they will not provide accelerated payment or process manufacturing claims. Moreover, some manufacturing rulings can take years to finalize. For example, one chemical company noted that CBP\u2019s lab analyzes every piece of the manufacturing process, and as a result, it is awaiting final decisions on new manufacturing rulings from 2013. Increase in number of claims: CBP has also seen an increase in the number of drawback claims because of TFTEA\u2019s changes to the drawback program and limitations in ACE. Prior to TFTEA, the number of drawback claims per calendar year ranged from 11,690 to 13,291. CBP saw a large increase in the number of drawback claims in 2018 and 2019. (See table 2.) CBP limited the number of lines in a drawback claim in ACE, which increased the number of drawback claims filed. Prior to TFTEA, claims were not limited by line. Because of system constraints, claims filed in ACE are restricted to 10,000 lines per claim. CBP had predicted that this ACE line limitation would increase the number of claims by a factor of four. Evidence to date indicates a significant increase in workload for certain Drawback Centers. For example, the Chicago Drawback Center noted that two claimants had filed over 4,000 claims between February 24, 2018 and February 23, 2019, whereas these same claimants had filed less than 50 claims in the prior year. According to the industry representatives we spoke with, the line limit in ACE added more work for industry and CBP because it made it necessary for claimants to break up the volume of their claims into different applications. For example, one broker used to file drawback claims four times a year on behalf of one refinery, but now has to file 300 times per year to account for the line limit. Drawback specialists pointed out that each claim stands on its own. As a result, they explained that they must liquidate each claim in ACE, which involves a number of quality control steps such as verifying that the claim is ready to be liquidated, relevant rulings are valid, and all validation activities are complete. As discussed earlier, the changes to the substitution standard have also led to an increase in new drawback claimants, according to CBP officials. CBP has received applications from over 500 new claimants since February 24, 2018. New claimants require additional work, including drawback specialists\u2019 manual reviews of claims, privilege applications, and ruling requests, as follows. Claims. Drawback specialists explained that drawback claims from new claimants are subject to a full desk review. The specialists will request supporting documentation to ensure that the appropriate statutory and regulatory requirements are met. They also determine drawback due on the basis of the completed drawback claim, the applicable general manufacturing drawback ruling or specific manufacturing drawback ruling, and any other relevant evidence or information. According to CBP, the time it takes a drawback specialist to conduct a full desk review varies by claim, based on the nature of the claim and the experience of the drawback specialist. CBP reported that it could take more than 3 years for CBP to conduct a full desk review and determine the final disposition of a drawback claim. Privilege applications. Claimants can also apply for privileges including accelerated payment privileges, a waiver of prior notice of intent to export or destroy, or a one-time waiver of prior notice of intent to export or destroy. Claimants must continue to submit paper applications for such privileges and drawback specialists must manually review the privilege applications. According to CBP, most claims are eligible for accelerated payment of drawback refunds. Manufacturing rulings. Lastly, if a claimant is seeking either a direct identification manufacturing drawback or a substitution manufacturing drawback, it must manually apply for a manufacturing ruling using a paper form submitted through email, which may require significant documentation and review, as discussed earlier. CBP maintains the manufacturing rulings as paper files. For example, the Drawback Center in Newark stores manufacturing rulings in rows of filing cabinets. (See fig. 11.) Additionally, CBP has not been able to respond to all privilege applications within 90 days, as set forth in the regulations. Between February 2018 and July 2019, CBP received almost 600 new privilege applications. CBP missed the 90-day deadline about 60 percent of the time. According to drawback specialists, they missed this deadline because of their workload. According to an industry representative, delays in processing privilege applications mean companies cannot receive their drawback money in a timely manner. Such delays cause uncertainty for industry, potentially impeding trade. Drawback specialists face new obstacles to managing automatic liquidation of drawback claims in ACE. According to CBP officials, previously, drawback specialists had at least 10 days of lead time to address an automatic liquidation. Now, Drawback Centers must continually monitor the automatic liquidation reports. Because of the way ACE operates, drawback specialists may only have 1 day of lead time before a claim automatically liquidates. According to drawback supervisors, such monitoring is significantly increasing their workload. Further, drawback specialists told us that one way they were managing their increased workload was by extending automatic liquidation, which can be done up to three times, as discussed in appendix II. This practice goes directly against CBP\u2019s guidance. Moreover, if they continue this practice, specialists may be forced to liquidate claims at zero if they run out of extensions. Further, as the workload continues to grow, Drawback Centers continue to face staffing shortages. As of October 26, 2019, CBP met the congressionally mandated staffing level for drawback specialists of 37 for the first time in over 5 years. In CBP\u2019s 2017 Resource Optimization Model, it reported an optimal staffing level of 40 to meet its drawback staffing needs. CBP\u2019s staffing level of 37, as of October 2019, did not meet this target. According to CBP officials, although Drawback Centers are utilizing overtime, the drawback specialists are not able to keep up with the influx of work. CBP has not adequately managed its drawback workload because it did not anticipate the increase in workload and did not plan for the increase accordingly. Federal standards for internal control note that management should evaluate performance and hold individuals accountable for their internal control responsibilities, which include evaluating pressure on personnel to help personnel fulfill their assigned responsibilities in accordance with the entity\u2019s standards of conduct. Management can adjust excessive pressures using many different tools, such as rebalancing workloads or increasing resource levels. However, CBP has not brought staffing to its optimal level, and has not adjusted the workload in Drawback Centers through ACE to account for the increase in claims, rulings, and privilege applications. Prior to TFTEA, CBP officials explained that CBP could not control the workload of the Drawback Centers because claimants mailed their paper-based claims to the Drawback Center of their choice. Now, CBP has greater visibility and flexibility to potentially control the work flow to the Drawback Centers through ACE, but has not done so. CBP officials said they had anticipated that ACE automation would reduce drawback specialists\u2019 workload, but experience, to date, indicates that workload increased. Until CBP develops a plan for managing its increased workload, it risks further delays in drawback claim processing that result in uncertainty for industry, potentially impeding trade\u2014which runs counter to its strategic goal of enhancing U.S. competitiveness by enabling lawful trade and travel, such as by reducing barriers to the efficient flow of trade and streamlining and unifying processes and procedures. CBP has taken steps to mitigate improper payment risks in the drawback program. Specifically, CBP expects three key changes to the drawback process under modernization will strengthen its ability to validate claims and recover inaccurately claimed drawback refunds: (1) requiring electronic filing in ACE, (2) extending the record retention period, and (3) broadening liability. However, CBP has not addressed several other risks for improper payments in the drawback program. These risks relate to (1) limitations in CBP\u2019s existing desk review process, (2) establishing electronic proof of export, and (3) targeting a selection of claims for review. TFTEA contained provisions amending the drawback statute that CBP expects will help it to remediate certain internal control deficiencies over drawback claim processing. Prior independent audits identified significant or material internal control weaknesses related to CBP\u2019s processing of drawback claims, including that CBP\u2019s drawback system lacked effective automated controls to prevent the overpayment of drawback claims and that the record retention period was not appropriate to ensure that support for drawback claims was maintained for the length of the drawback claim lifecycle. CBP expects that three key changes to the drawback process under modernization will strengthen its ability to validate claims and recover inaccurately claimed drawback refunds, as follows. Requiring the electronic filing of drawback claims. On February 24, 2019, the drawback program fully transitioned to ACE. Specifically, all drawback claims are now required to be filed electronically in ACE and include drawback entry summary data at the more detailed line item level. Line item reporting requires claimants to provide certain relevant information for the designated imported merchandise on a drawback claim associated with the line item on an import entry summary, including the tariff classification, quantity, and value, as well as the duties, taxes, and fees assessed thereon. With electronic filing and line item reporting, CBP can now automatically compare and verify the amounts of duties, taxes, and fees claimed on the drawback claim against the amounts paid on the import entry summary, which CBP expects will help ensure that it does not overpay funds. CBP\u2019s prior system for filing drawback claims did not have the capability to electronically compare and verify claims against underlying import entries upon which the drawback claim was based to determine whether an excessive amount had been claimed at the individual line item level, according to prior independent audits. CBP\u2019s transition to ACE is intended to mitigate risks of improper payments on drawback-related imports, by helping to ensure through automated validations that the amount paid for drawback claims against a given import entry does not exceed 99 percent of the duties, taxes, and fees collected at the individual line item level. Extending the record retention period for certain drawback claims. For all TFTEA drawback claims, supporting records must now be maintained for a period of 3 years from the date of liquidation of the claim, rather than 3 years from the date CBP pays a drawback claimant. This new time frame requires claimants with accelerated payment privileges to maintain supporting records for a longer period than before modernization. Prior to modernization, the drawback record retention period sometimes fell short of the time in which CBP liquidated a drawback claim, preventing CBP from substantiating a claim with complete documentation. The extension of the record retention period provides CBP with more time to request documents needed to verify claims during desk reviews, which in turn should strengthen its ability to recoup over claimed drawback refunds. According to CBP officials, if a claimant fails to provide documents as directed, or if the documents do not support the claim as presented, CBP can liquidate the claim at $0, or other diminishment as appropriate, and ACE will then issue a bill for outstanding funds owed. Broadening liability for drawback claims. Following TFTEA, liability for the full amount of a drawback claim shifted from the claimant to both the claimant and the importer of the designated imported merchandise upon which drawback refunds are claimed. CBP expects that establishing joint and several liability, consistent with TFTEA, will help it to recoup over claimed drawback refunds by holding the importer of record, in addition to the claimant, responsible for payment of erroneous or false drawback claims. According to the industry representatives we spoke to, the impact of the joint and several liability change remains to be seen, but it could limit the incentive of importers to engage in drawback filing with exporters or claimants to avoid liability. In addition to implementing these statutory changes, CBP has been working with a statistician to develop a more robust basis for sampling and selecting claims for review. For example, CBP has determined that it will target higher-value claims for more frequent review. CBP lacks effective automated controls to prevent overpayment of drawback refunds related to export information. CBP guidance notes that a statutory prohibition on multiple drawback claims is set forth in 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1313(v), which restricts the use of merchandise that is exported or destroyed to a single claim for drawback. Unlike import information, which is included in ACE to allow CBP to electronically compare and verify claims against underlying import entries, similar export information is not included in ACE. Therefore, CBP cannot perform electronic comparisons of export data within ACE to help ensure that it does not make overpayments on drawback-related exports. For example, if a claimant exported 10 widgets and filed one drawback claim for six exported widgets and another claim for five exported widgets, CBP would not be able to systematically verify that the second drawback claim was excessive and thus invalid. To compensate for the lack of automated controls, CBP designed an internal control for the drawback program that targets a selection of claims for a manual full desk review by drawback specialists. (See appendix II for an explanation of what such desk reviews involve). However, CBP has not addressed several other risks for improper payments in the drawback program. These risks relate to (1) limitations in CBP\u2019s existing desk review process, (2) establishing electronic proof of export, and (3) targeting a selection of claims for review. CBP\u2019s existing manual desk review process does not have the ability to systematically confirm the validity of export documentation and confirm that export documentation is accurately being used across multiple claims. CBP officials noted that, while export documentation could be used across multiple claims, by law, claimants cannot file multiple drawback claims based on the same exported merchandise, as discussed above. Under TFTEA, a person claiming drawback refunds based on the exportation of an item must provide proof of export. Such proof must establish fully the date and fact of exportation and the identity of the exporter and may be established through the use of records kept in the normal course of business or through an electronic export system, as determined by CBP. To comply with this requirement, CBP requires claimants to (1) provide summary data as part of the drawback claim in ACE that includes the date of export, name of exporter, description of the goods, quantity and unit of measure, tariff classification number, and country of ultimate destination; and (2) maintain actual proof of export, which can be records kept in the normal course of business, and provide such proof upon demand by CBP. However, CBP officials told us that claimants only provide proof of export upon request by the drawback specialist, and that such requests typically are made after the claim is accepted in ACE and only in the context of desk reviews. Drawback specialists do not routinely request, store, or compare export documentation except for claims selected for desk reviews. CBP has no way of tracking whether claimants are using their export information excessively, and, according to officials, CBP has not yet assessed the feasibility of doing so. CBP officials explained that having the ability to flag excessive export submissions across multiple claims would enhance CBP\u2019s protection against over claiming, but that further review is needed to determine whether flagging is feasible with current system capabilities. CBP officials said that they intend to look further into the matter in fiscal year 2020. As a result, the drawback program remains at risk of improper payments on drawback related to export information as claimants could over claim drawback refunds by using non-existent, insufficient, or falsified export documentation, or by reusing export documentation across multiple claims for merchandise that was never exported. CBP has not taken any steps to establish electronic proof of export, although it has a longstanding goal to designate the Automated Export System as an electronic means of establishing proof of export. Federal standards for internal control call for agency management to design the entity\u2019s information system and related control activities to achieve objectives and respond to risks. However, CBP has not yet deemed the Automated Export System as a reliable system of record for proof of export. At the time the final rule was issued in December 2018, CBP commented that the Automated Export System, as it stands, could not provide sufficient proof of export, and CBP would therefore continue to require documentary proof of export until further notice. Specifically, CBP determined that the Automated Export System does not establish the date and fact of exportation, or the identity of the exporter\u2014information that can be relied upon to demonstrate drawback eligibility. CBP officials in headquarters told us that while being able to develop a reliable system of record for proof of export remains a goal, CBP does not have a plan or time frames for doing so as it intends to revisit the matter in fiscal year 2020. CBP officials explained that their focus has been on transitioning the drawback program to ACE, including by training staff and addressing industry concerns. Until CBP implements effective control activities for the drawback program, the government may be subject to revenue loss through duplicate or excessive claims for drawback related to export information. We cannot precisely estimate the potential savings that might result from CBP taking steps to prevent over-claims because the current rate of improperly claiming against the same export documentation multiple times is unknown. Further, the current number and amount of drawback claims improperly using export information is unknown. However, if these steps reduced drawback-related costs by even 1 percent of the over $1 billion in annual drawback refunds, this could equate to millions of dollars in savings. CBP has not targeted a selection of claims for a manual full desk review since it disabled the selection feature in ACE, and the number of claims not targeted for review continues to increase because CBP has not turned the selection feature back on. The lack of review increases the risks of improper payments for claims filed, which stood at over 35,000 as of August 23, 2019, and represented an estimated $2 billion. To mitigate risks of improper payments in the drawback program, CBP designed an internal control for the drawback program in which a selection of claims is targeted for a manual full desk review by drawback specialists. Prior to modernization, CBP officials told us that they would target 1 percent of the claims per claimant and 1 percent of the entries on a drawback claim for a full desk review. Drawback specialists provided examples of having conducted full desk reviews in which they discovered that the claimants had failed to substantiate the claim by, for example, providing insufficient proof of export. They explained that the claimants had to repay their drawback refund and had CBP target subsequent claims for a limited desk review. However, CBP officials explained that when CBP transitioned the drawback program to ACE starting on February 24, 2018, a system error forced CBP to disable the selection feature in ACE. Certain claims that have been submitted since the system error was discovered have not been targeted for a full desk review. Federal standards for internal control call for agency management to identify, analyze, and respond to risks related to achieving the defined objectives. These standards note that agency managers should comprehensively identify risks and analyze them for their possible effects, as well as design responses to these risks as necessary to mitigate them. CBP officials told us that they are working toward turning the selection feature back on as soon as CBP can address the system error. However, CBP did not expect the issue to persist as long as it has to date (22 months, as of December 2019). As a result, even when the selection feature is reactivated, it will only be applied to new claims filed after that point. CBP does not have a plan to retroactively target claims for review that had already been accepted in ACE during the system error, or to identify and analyze risks from targeting to adjust targeting in the future. For example, CBP has not determined whether specific claimant characteristics or claim types are more frequently associated with compliance problems. CBP officials explained that analyzing risks from targeting to identify non-compliance patterns across claimants is not something CBP has done in the past because CBP is account based and does not compare claims across claimants. However, CBP officials acknowledged the feasibility\u2014with ACE\u2019s new capabilities\u2014of systematically pulling and analyzing non-compliance data input into ACE by the drawback specialists during limited or full desk reviews, and told us that they intend to explore this matter further in fiscal year 2020. These officials stated that taking these steps would be valuable for improving risk management in the drawback program and that doing so is likely to be feasible with current staff resources. Without finalizing or implementing procedures to retroactively target claims for review and taking steps to analyze non-compliance patterns to improve future compliance processes, CBP may miss opportunities to protect U.S. trade revenue from improper payments of drawback claims. We cannot precisely estimate the potential savings that might result from CBP pursuing claims from the period when the selection feature was disabled, because the amount of drawback recovery resulting from the review of this universe is unknown, and the actual amount would depend on the number of reviews conducted, amount of improper payments discovered, and ability to recover these payments. However, if these reviews recovered even half of 1 percent of the $2 billion in un-reviewed claims, this could equate to millions of dollars in additional recoveries. CBP published a required Regulatory Impact Analysis of the Modernized Drawback Final Rule (RIA) of new drawback regulations in 2018 to outline, prospectively, the anticipated consequences of this economically significant regulatory action. The RIA was to include a quantification and monetization of anticipated benefits and costs, to the best extent possible with information available at the time. As of December 2019, CBP\u2019s RIA was the only formal analysis that had been conducted on the impact of changes to drawback eligibility under modernization on industry and government. We assessed three key portions of the RIA relating to impact on industry and changes to drawback eligibility against GAO\u2019s standards for review of economic analysis, and found that CBP had not produced reliable estimates. Various factors limited the analyses that CBP could conduct. For example, because the RIA was published prospectively, post- modernization program data were, necessarily, not yet available. According to CBP officials, CBP also developed the RIA before it had transitioned to ACE, a database with enhanced capabilities. However, in some cases, we found that CBP was not transparent about the level of uncertainty in its assumptions resulting from these limitations. We did not comprehensively assess the entire RIA (a 251-page document containing more than 90 tables) or assess any of it against the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s guidelines for an RIA. Therefore, the following discussion of the RIA is not an assessment of whether the RIA met the criteria for required regulatory analyses outlined in the Office of Management and Budget Circular A-4. Our assessment of each of the relevant portions of the RIA is based on GAO\u2019s standards for review of economic analysis, and outlined below. Affected industries: CBP determined that a wide range of industries would be affected by modernization but did not determine whether the dollar impact of eligibility changes from modernization would be more concentrated in some industries than in others because of data limitations. To reach the conclusion that a wide range of industries would be affected by modernization, CBP took a sample of companies that had submitted drawback claims and examined these companies to determine their primary industry. According to GAO standards, an economic analysis should state its objective and the scope of the analysis should be designed to address this objective. According to CBP officials, CBP designed this sample to support statements about the number of companies affected but not the dollar size of the impact, although CBP did not explicitly state the intent of this design in the RIA. At the time of the RIA, according to these officials, designing a dollar-weighted sample\u2014which could support statements about which industries were most affected in terms of financial costs and benefits\u2014would have required a prohibitive amount of work with paper records. However, the officials noted that a dollar-weighted sample should now be feasible because most of the necessary information is now stored electronically in ACE. Expansion of substitution eligibility: CBP estimated that the expansion of substitution eligibility would account for $1 billion (98 percent) of the $1.02 billion estimated total 10-year amount of increased drawback refunds under modernization; however, we found that this estimate was not reliable because of the amount of uncertainty in key assumptions. According to GAO standards, an economic analysis should consider all relevant alternatives and describe and justify the analytical choices, assumptions, and data used. CBP\u2019s estimate was based on assumptions about changes to the dollar amount per drawback claim and number of drawback claims as a result of modernization and system limitations in the number of lines per claim. Specifically, CBP assumed that claim values would remain equal to their historical average (adjusted for line limitations in ACE) and that the number of claims under modernization would grow primarily in the first year after modernization. However, CBP did not justify some key methodological assumptions about the amount and number of claims and did not take sufficient steps to inform on the extent to which the conclusions of the analysis would remain similar, even if it changed some of these assumptions. CBP estimated the dollar amount per claim based on a historical average of drawback claim amounts but did not explain in the RIA why the historical average is an appropriate assumption for drawback claim amount. CBP officials told us that they considered a range of different drawback claim amount values and growth rates as a result of significant annual variation in drawback claim amounts prior to TFTEA. However, CBP did not include variation in claim dollar amounts in its published sensitivity analyses for this table or otherwise discuss, within the scope of these analyses, whether its conclusions would have been affected by this variation in the assumed amount per claim. Additionally, CBP\u2019s estimate of expected increase in the number of claims that would be filed under modernization contains several key assumptions that it justifies based on emails and discussions with industry representatives and CBP subject matter experts, the details of which are not transparent in the RIA. We reviewed these emails and found that the two industry representatives whom CBP cited expressed uncertainty about the effects of modernization and provided estimates of growth in substitution drawback claims that varied by 20 percentage points from one another. CBP also sought public comments on these estimates and did not receive any, according to officials. As the estimated effect of this change constitutes nearly all of the estimated increase in drawback refunds in the RIA, the uncertainty around key assumptions for this analysis means that the overall actual effects of modernization could differ widely from CBP\u2019s estimate. Limitations on basket provisions: CBP estimated that eliminating claims with basket provisions would cost industry about $11 million over 10 years; however, we found that this estimate was not reliable because of the amount of uncertainty in key assumptions. According to GAO standards, an economic analysis should consider all relevant alternatives and describe and justify the analytical choices, assumptions, and data used. These standards further note that, when feasible, an economic analysis should adequately quantify how the statistical variability of the key data elements underlying the estimates of the economic analysis impacts these estimates. While CBP\u2019s general methodology was reasonable, its sample design was too small to ensure reliable results and some assumptions were not fully explained or transparent. CBP sampled 50 out of 2,346 substitution unused merchandise claims from 2016, of which 16 contained lines classified under basket provisions in the HTS code, and used this sample to estimate the number of affected claims and lines, as well as average affected line value. CBP officials told us that CBP selected this sample size because of the labor-intensive process required to examine paper records from the relevant claims. However, in the RIA, CBP did not discuss how this small sample size caused imprecision in its estimates. Further, CBP did not establish that this time-limited sample was generalizable beyond 2016, either for the proportion of affected claims and lines or for the average affected line value. CBP officials said that, to alleviate these issues, CBP sought public comments on these estimates and did not receive any. According to CBP officials, at the time of their analysis, there was no evidence about the average dollar amount of future claims. However, CBP did not conduct a sensitivity analysis on these assumptions, for example, to determine how much its estimates would change if the number or dollar amount of claims utilizing basket provisions was larger or smaller than CBP had assumed. Beyond its RIA, CBP has not conducted economic impact analysis of the changes to drawback eligibility under modernization, including on industry, and does not have plans to do so in the near future. Because the changes are new and CBP has devoted many of its resources to rolling out modernization, CBP stated that, while it intends to follow relevant requirements for regulatory review, it has not yet prioritized developing a plan for further assessments of the economic impact of the regulation. CBP officials stated that any future plans for retrospective review would follow Treasury guidance. This guidance states that priorities for retrospective review projects of existing significant regulations should be based upon an understanding of the economic impact of the regulatory action on industry and the government, among other factors. According to the RIA, the drawback modernization regulations are an \u201ceconomically significant regulatory action.\u201d The Treasury guidance states that such an understanding can be achieved through an ex post analysis of the effects of the regulation on the public, industry, or the government, including increased revenue or costs. An ex post analysis of impact on industry and the impact of major changes to drawback eligibility would have fewer limitations than the RIA, which analyzed the changes prospectively (using historical data to predict future outcomes). For example, because of system updates, more detailed data about lines within claims are now stored electronically, which may reduce the need to conduct sampling in order to estimate the impact of changes. Additionally, because the regulation is now in effect, information such as the number of claims filed can be determined with actual data rather than by projection. According to CBP officials, within 3 to 5 years the agency will have sufficient data to conduct a reliable ex post analysis of the impact of the changes. Useful analysis might be possible sooner, as well. CBP assumed in the RIA that some of the most important effects of modernization would occur in the first year. According to GAO standards, the reliability of an ex post analysis will depend not only on the sufficiency of data, but also on whether the analysis has considered and properly dealt with elements such as objective and scope, methodology, analysis of effects, transparency, and documentation. At present, however, CBP has not prioritized developing a plan with time frames to conduct such an analysis when the data are available\u2014a plan that could include identifying key areas of analysis, data sources, and appropriate methodologies. Without an ex post analysis, CBP cannot reliably determine the financial effects of changes to drawback refund eligibility on industry and the government. CBP disburses about $1 billion in drawback refunds per year and expects the amount of drawback refunds dispersed to continue growing. According to CBP, TFTEA modernized CBP\u2019s system for processing drawback claims, transitioning it from a paper-based to an electronic system, in an attempt to mitigate longstanding risks in the program. Despite the expected increase in drawback claims, CBP did not anticipate and then adequately manage the increase in drawback specialists\u2019 workload. As a result, CBP has delayed timely processing of some drawback claims, rulings, and privilege applications, which has resulted in uncertainty for industry\u2014potentially impeding trade. Since modernization, drawback claims continue to be at risk of improper payments with vulnerabilities in CBP\u2019s export verification and quality control system. While drawback modernization addressed longstanding risks associated with the program by automatically verifying import information, export information still creates a risk. CBP cannot systematically verify the validity and accuracy of a company\u2019s proof of export. As a result, companies could still over claim drawback refunds by using non-existent, insufficient, or falsified export documentation, or by reusing export documentation across multiple claims. Additionally, while CBP established internal controls to mitigate improper payment risks in the program, such as by targeting a selection of claims for review, it disabled this quality control measure for claims submitted since drawback modernization began in February 2018. Over 35,000 claims accepted since drawback modernization\u2014amounting to over $2 billion\u2014remain at risk for noncompliance. Without CBP finalizing and implementing procedures to target claims retroactively and in the future, CBP will continue to miss opportunities to protect U.S. trade revenue. Further, if CBP does not design its targeting system to mitigate identified risks, future claims also are at risk of noncompliance. Prior to drawback modernization, CBP was not able to produce a reliable assessment of the economic impact of the changes to the drawback program on industry and government because of data availability constraints, systems limitations, and other factors. However, modernization has eliminated some of these constraints, and CBP estimates that within several years it will have sufficient data to conduct an ex post analysis. However, CBP has not prioritized developing a plan to do so. Without such an analysis, CBP cannot be certain about the economic impact of drawback modernization. We are making a total of six recommendations to CBP. Specifically: The Commissioner of CBP should ensure that the Office of Field Operations, in consultation with the Office of Trade, develops a plan for managing its increased workload. (Recommendation 1) The Commissioner of CBP should ensure that the Office of Trade assesses the feasibility of flagging excessive export submissions across multiple claims and takes cost-effective steps, based on the assessment, to prevent over claiming. (Recommendation 2) The Commissioner of CBP should ensure that the Office of Trade develops a plan, with time frames, to establish a reliable system of record for proof of export. (Recommendation 3) The Commissioner of CBP should ensure that the Office of Trade turns the claim selection feature in ACE back on and finalizes and implements procedures to target claims for review that were accepted into ACE during the period in which the selection feature was disabled. (Recommendation 4) The Commissioner of CBP should ensure that the Office of Trade analyzes the results of its targeting of claims for review and designs responses to mitigate identified risks. (Recommendation 5) The Commissioner of CBP should ensure that the Office of Trade prioritizes developing a plan to conduct an ex post analysis of the impact on industry and government of key changes to the drawback program, including time frames and methodology. (Recommendation 6) We provided a draft of this report to CBP and Treasury for comment. In its comments, reproduced in appendix III, CBP concurred with all six of our recommendations. CBP also provided technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate. We requested comments from Treasury, but none were provided. We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional committees, the Commissioner of CBP, and the Secretary of Treasury. In addition, the report will be available at no charge on the GAO website at http://www.gao.gov. If you or your staff have any questions about this report, please contact me at (202) 512-8612 or gianopoulosk@gao.gov. Contact points for our Offices of Congressional Relations and Public Affairs may be found on the last page of this report. GAO staff who made key contributions to this report are listed in appendix IV. This report examines (1) the extent to which modernization affects drawback refund eligibility and U.S. Customs and Border Protection\u2019s (CBP) management of its workload, as well as the extent to which CBP has (2) taken steps to address risks of improper payments in the program and (3) analyzed the impact of the changes to the program on industry and government. To examine the extent to which modernization affects drawback refund eligibility and CBP\u2019s management of its workload, we reviewed statutory, regulatory, and agency drawback documents to identify and describe expansions and limitations to drawback refund eligibility. Specifically, we reviewed the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015 (TFTEA), the Modernized Drawback Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, and the Modernized Drawback Final Rule to identify key changes resulting from amendments made to the drawback statute and implementing regulations. We also reviewed CBP\u2019s internal guidance, which defines the standards that drawback specialists must meet when processing claims for drawback refunds in the Automated Commercial Environment (ACE) and under TFTEA. To understand the regulations and policies for drawback modernization, we interviewed CBP officials with the Offices of Regulations and Rulings and Trade Policy and Programs within the Office of Trade. To gain insight into how drawback modernization is working, in practice, we interviewed CBP officials from the Office of Field Operations and the four Drawback Centers. We visited the largest Drawback Centers, located in Newark, New Jersey, and San Francisco, California, to observe how they manage their workload and process claims. As context for CBP\u2019s increasing workload following drawback modernization, we also collected data on the following: The number of drawback claims filed in calendar years 2018 and 2019, as of August 21, 2019. We also compared these data against the historical number of drawback claims filed from 2009 through 2017, as reported by CBP in its Regulatory Impact Analysis of the Modernized Drawback Final Rule (RIA). In addition, we reported on the amount of drawback claimed during this period as context for the size of the drawback program. TFTEA (1) provided for a transition period, from February 24, 2018 to February 23, 2019, during which drawback claimants could file under either the amended provisions or the drawback law as it existed previously; and (2) thereafter required all claims to be filed under TFTEA starting on February 24, 2019. As such, claims filed between 2009 and 2017 reflect pre-TFTEA drawback claims. Claims filed in 2018 and 2019 reflect drawback claims filed under both the amended provisions and the drawback law as it existed previously. The number and value of claims migrated to ACE from the Automated Commercial System\u2014CBP\u2019s prior system for filing drawback claims\u2014 as well as the number and value of these claims liquidated in the first 9 months of 2019. The number of limited modifications to existing manufacturing rulings submitted between February 24, 2018 and February 23, 2019. Claimants who wanted to operate under an existing manufacturing ruling were required to file a supplemental application for a limited modification to the existing ruling by February 23, 2019. The number of new manufacturing rulings submitted between February 24, 2019 and July 22, 2019. Claimants who want to operate under a manufacturing ruling but did not apply for a limited modification by February 23, 2019, need to apply for a new manufacturing ruling. The number of privilege applications submitted between February 24, 2018 and July 22, 2019. Claimants can apply for and obtain drawback privileges for accelerated payment and waiver of prior notice. We incorporated data reliability questions in our interviews with agency officials, such as how the data are derived, maintained, and updated, and how CBP ensures their completeness and accuracy. Based on our interviews with agency officials, we found these data to be sufficiently reliable for providing context for CBP\u2019s growing workload since modernization. We then discussed steps that CBP had taken to manage its workload, such as how it had updated its staffing models, managed processing privilege applications, and managed automatic liquidation. We assessed CBP\u2019s responses against federal standards for internal control, which call for agency management to evaluate pressure on personnel to help personnel fulfill their assigned responsibilities in accordance with the entity\u2019s standards for conduct. We reviewed staffing data covering fiscal years 2014 through 2019 for drawback specialists. We previously reported on staffing data from fiscal years 2014 through 2016. We incorporated data reliability questions in our interviews with agency officials for the fiscal years 2017 through 2019 staffing data. To determine staffing shortfalls, we compared actual staffing data against the minimum staffing level mandated by the Homeland Security Act and the optimal staffing level identified in CBP\u2019s Resource Optimization Model for 2017. We determined these data to be sufficiently reliable for the purposes of comparing actual to optimal and mandated staffing levels. In addition, to understand how CBP is implementing the changes to the drawback program under modernization and the impact of the changes to the program, we interviewed a non-generalizable sample of 15 industry representatives from a variety of sectors who (a) had submitted public comments on the proposed rule, (b) were part of CBP\u2019s Trade Support Network Drawback Subcommittee, or (c) met our criteria for both (a) and (b). According to CBP officials, this subcommittee was CBP\u2019s primary forum through which officials obtained input on the modernized drawback regulations from industry. We developed a standard set of questions to ask industry representatives, for example, regarding their company\u2019s involvement in the drawback program, how drawback modernization has impacted their company, what industries have been most impacted by the changes, and any unexpected or unintended results of the modernization. To examine the extent to which CBP has taken steps to address risks of improper payments in the program, we reviewed prior independent audits of the program, as well as statutory, regulatory, and agency documents delineating changes to the program, to understand how the changes are expected to remediate prior audit findings. These documents included TFTEA, as well as CBP\u2019s proposed and final rules for modernized drawback, the RIA, and internal and external guidance for filing and processing drawback claims. We also interviewed agency officials in headquarters and in the field to discuss prior audit findings and the successes and challenges, if any, to drawback modernization addressing identified issues. We then assessed steps that CBP had taken to mitigate improper payment risks in the drawback program against federal standards for internal control, which call for agency management to identify, analyze, and respond to risks related to achieving the defined objectives. We collected data on the number of claims filed between February 24, 2018 and August 23, 2019, and the total amount claimed, that were not targeted for a full desk review. Based on our interviews with agency officials, we found the data to be sufficiently reliable for the purposes of reporting on the total number and value of claims that were not targeted for a full desk review during this period. To examine the extent to which CBP has analyzed the impact of the changes to the program on industry and government, we evaluated CBP\u2019s RIA against GAO\u2019s standards for review of economic analysis. We assessed those portions of the RIA that relate directly to the financial impact of changes to drawback eligibility, corresponding to three tables describing (1) affected industries, (2) expansion of substitution eligibility, and (3) limitation of basket provisions. We then compared our assessments against applicable Department of the Treasury standards to determine if a future assessment could overcome the prior data limitations, warranting a limited review of certain aspects of an existing rule. However, we did not comprehensively assess the RIA (a 251-page document containing more than 90 tables) or assess it against the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s standards for regulatory impact analysis. Therefore, our discussion of the RIA is not an assessment of whether the RIA met the criteria for required regulatory analyses outlined in the Office of Management and Budget Circular A-4. We conducted this performance audit from February 2018 to December 2019 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. Drawback claim filing and processing generally follows three steps. Claims are (1) submitted for initial acceptance or rejection, (2) reviewed for drawback eligibility as applicable, and (3) liquidated with full, partial, or no payment. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials indicated that while the transition from the Automated Commercial System (ACS) to the Automated Commercial Environment (ACE) under drawback modernization has automated the initial intake of drawback claims, the review of claims to determine drawback eligibility, as presented, remains largely a manual process. 1. Claim submission. Prior to modernization, claimants had to file paper claims, including supporting documentation. CBP was required to accept or reject claims and authorize accelerated payment within 90 days of receiving the paper claim. However, claimants could also submit an electronic summary of the claim, known as a shell record, through ACS. For accelerated payment claims with a shell record, CBP was required to certify the approved claim for payment within 21 days of receiving the electronic summary of the claim. Under modernization, claims must be filed electronically. The drawback claim is transmitted electronically via ACE and supporting documentation, when required, is uploaded via the Document Image System component of ACE. CBP officials explained that the transition to ACE had automated the initial intake process of drawback claims. Instead of a drawback specialist having to manually validate the claim for completeness and mail a response back to the claimant, ACE is able to make that determination within seconds and provide immediate feedback to the claimant on whether the claim is accepted or, if rejected, what errors need to be addressed. 2. Claim review. CBP policy before and after modernization has been to require a full or limited desk review of selected claims, according to CBP officials. Claims necessitating a drawback specialist\u2019s full desk review will undergo a more comprehensive verification of the complete drawback claim that often requires additional information from the claimant. If additional information is required to process the drawback claim, CBP will send a formal request for information to the claimant. Additionally, CBP officials said that before and after modernization, if CBP identified compliance issues during its review of a drawback claim, the drawback specialist could target any subsequent claims filed by the claimant for a limited desk review. According to CBP officials, the time it takes a drawback specialist to conduct a desk review varies by claim, based on the nature of the claim and the experience of the drawback specialist. CBP reported that it could take more than 3 years for CBP to conduct a full desk review and determine the final disposition of a drawback claim. 3. Claim liquidation and payment. Prior to modernization, CBP would manually verify that drawback claimants had the accelerated payment privilege on file. CBP stated that claimants with the privilege of accelerated payment of drawback generally received their refunds 14 days after CBP accepted claims and authorized accelerated payment. Now, under drawback modernization, a claimant can receive accelerated payment without a drawback specialist\u2019s involvement. ACE is programmed to automatically make accelerated payment on claims that have on file the accelerated payment privilege and a drawback bond that equals or exceeds the amount of the claim(s). CBP stated that claimants with the privilege of accelerated payment generally receive their refunds within 21 days of claim acceptance. Before and after modernization, drawback claims are set to automatically liquidate if all the designated import entries within a claim are liquidated and final within 1 year of the claim date, according to CBP officials. CBP officials said that drawback specialists must extend the claim to prevent it from automatically liquidating before the necessary reviews have been completed. Drawback claims can be extended for three 1-year periods. CBP officials explained that liquidation extensions are intended to provide additional time to obtain information or documentation necessary to complete the review of a drawback claim. If the claimant fails to provide documents as directed, or if the documents do not support the claim as presented, the claim will be liquidated based on the information on file, which may result in liquidation at $0, or other diminishment, as appropriate. CBP officials described the liquidation and payment of drawback claims with and without accelerated payment privileges, as follows. At the time of liquidation, for claims with accelerated payment privileges, ACE issues an additional refund if the final claimed amount is greater than the accelerated payment amount, or a bill, if the accelerated payment amount is greater than the final claimed amount. If the accelerated payment amount is the same as the amount determined at liquidation, no further action is necessary. For claims without accelerated payment privileges, ACE will issue a refund for the drawback amount approved at liquidation. Claimants have 30 days from the issuance of a bill to repay CBP any amount due. Claims may be reliquidated up to 90 days from the date of an original liquidation.

    "human_reference": "The United States enacted the drawback program in 1789 to create jobs and encourage manufacturing and exports, according to CBP. CBP has primary responsibility for overseeing the drawback program. It disburses about $1 billion in drawback refunds per year. According to CBP, TFTEA modernized the drawback program, generally broadening the scope of potential claims and allowing electronic filing starting February 24, 2018. As of February 24, 2019, claimants could only file claims under the drawback statute as amended by TFTEA. TFTEA also included a provision for GAO to assess drawback modernization. This report examines the extent to which (1) modernization affects drawback refund eligibility and CBP's management of its workload, (2) CBP has taken steps to address risks of improper payments in the program, and (3) CBP has analyzed the impact of the changes to the program on industry and government. GAO reviewed statutory, regulatory, and agency documents, and interviewed agency officials and industry representatives. The Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015 (TFTEA) generally expanded eligibility for the drawback program, which provides refunds to claimants of up to 99 percent of certain customs duties, taxes, and fees. For example, a claimant could claim a drawback refund on exported pants made in the United States using imported foreign fabric. The expansion from TFTEA has resulted in Customs and Border Protection (CBP) facing a growing workload. According to CBP officials, the most significant change from TFTEA is that it is now easier to qualify for certain drawback refunds. Industry representatives explained that new claimants are seeking drawback refunds and existing claimants are able to increase claim amounts. However, CBP has not adequately managed the increased workload and has not developed a plan for doing so. As a result, CBP faces delays in processing drawback claims that could result in uncertainty for industry, potentially impeding trade. GAO Example of One Potential Drawback Claim CBP has taken some steps to address risks of improper payments in the drawback program, but several risks remain. To help ensure it does not overpay funds, CBP now electronically verifies drawback claims against underlying import information. However, CBP cannot verify drawback claims against underlying export information because it does not maintain detailed information about exports in its new electronic system. To compensate for this lack of automated controls, CBP requires manual full desk reviews of a selection of claims to mitigate improper payment risks. However, CBP has not targeted certain claims for a full desk review since switching to the new system on February 24, 2018. The lack of review for claims, which numbered over 35,000 and represented an estimated $2 billion in claims filed as of August 23, 2019, increases the risk of improper payments. CBP has not produced a reliable assessment of the economic impact of the changes to drawback refund eligibility because of data availability constraints, systems limitations, and other factors. CBP has not prioritized developing a plan to revisit its economic analysis, although new data and systems capabilities are becoming available. Without such a plan, CBP will not have a reliable assessment of the impact of the changes on industry and government. GAO is making six recommendations, including that CBP develop a plan for handling its drawback workload, improve its validation activities, and prioritize developing a plan for an economic analysis of the regulation to understand its impact. CBP concurred with all six recommendations.",

    "document": "Speaker 0: Okay. Well, Debbie Porter, you there you are. Do you want to come up and give a brief overview and then we'll hear from if it's okay with council, we'll hear from the public speakers and then we'll make our comments. Hello.\nSpeaker 10: Good evening, Council Mayor. I'm Debbie Potter, the community development director for the city. And the item before you this evening is a recommendation to approve a First Amendment to our agreement with a central league out to provide legal assistance to low income tenants. This was a contract that was approved in November of 2018. It was approved as a three year contract. It was funded for a total amount of $500,000, with the funding spread pretty much in equal parts across three years, about $166,000 per year. Last year, the first year of the contract was from November of 2018 to November of 2019. And at the conclusion of the first year of the contract staff, primarily myself and Michael Rausch from the City Attorney's Office, sat down with central legal staff to discuss how the first year had been, how they felt about their work scope and the service delivery. And based on the annual report, some of the quarterly reporting and conversations with staff, it was decided by both central legal staff as well as city staff, that it probably made sense to renegotiate the work scope for this current year of the contract. The second year of the three year contract staff is not recommending any additional funding or reduction in funding. Essentially, we're recommending a reallocation of funds with a revised work scope. The primary change is to modify the work scope so that there is a reduction in the number of folks served for the legal services to reduce that number and to reallocate funding for two general activities one to increase the budget for outreach. There have been some challenges in reaching some of the tenants. Low income tenants in Alameda. So Centro is proposing to do more robust outreach in this upcoming year. And then there is a recommendation to reallocate funds for an emergency financial assistance program. And that is a program that central legal has been running countywide. And in the city of Oakland since December of 2018. And Alameda tenants have been able to take advantage of that emergency financial assistance via Centro's contract with the county. That contract is set to expire in May of this year, and there is not yet a guarantee from the county whether that contract will be extended. And so the proposal is to augment those services and fund those services directly. In the city of Alameda, Alameda tenants have been the sink, the second highest users of this emergency financial assistance under the county contract. And it has been a great resource for keeping tenants in their homes and keeping tenants from becoming homeless. And that is a program that that Centro thinks that it can put to really good use in this upcoming year of of the contract. So that that's kind of a high level overview of what the recommendation is and what staff is recommending. I am happy to answer any questions after public comment.\nSpeaker 0: Do we have any clarifying questions about the staff report? Okay. Hearing that we'll move to. But did you have something.\nSpeaker 10: Else to say? Sorry. And I did want to point out that Monique Berlanga, the directing attorney, and Teresa Gonzalez, the executive director of Central Legal, are here this evening and they are available to to answer any questions.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Okay. Let's go to our public speakers, please.\nSpeaker 1: Terri Johansen and Kathryn Polley.\nSpeaker 8: You have to boil it down.\nSpeaker 2: Good evening, Mayor and Council. I would once again like to commend this mayor and this council for everything that you've done for renters in Alameda. I am a renter and I'm speaking tonight as a renter. I do feel like the renters have been one of the most vulnerable in our community. And with the efforts of this mayor and council, we have done a lot to protect people and to keep them in their homes and to thereby reduce the homeless population. That's just escalating. I think these changes of of reaching out to more community members and to offering them more services, especially the assistance when they need it, I think is a is a great expansion of the protection and the parachute. If you're going to go sailing at 100 miles an hour, the parachute and the safety net that you all have provided. So I, I commend you all for all of the protections you have have afforded our renters and hope this continues in the future.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Thank you, Ms.. Pike.\nSpeaker 5: I want to add my appreciation to Cherise. I think you all have been doing tremendous work on so many different levels regarding Central Ago. What we are hearing since Jessica's evictions came into effect is we are getting a lot more calls, a lot more questions, not just about habitability, but about buildings being sold. I feel that now that we have just cause protections, tenants seem more willing to come out and talk about it. And the next step is, if things are advancing or complicated, we will be doing more room for referrals to Centro Legal. So thank you for having this program in place. I feel like there's a lot of progress being made and it's going to be a tremendous help to the tenants there. The changes mentioned, I think, are smart. I know that a lot of Alameda residents excuse me, a lot of Alameda residents have drawn on that Alameda County money through central legal. So that is a very positive step and to make sure that that that is continued to keep people housed. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. We have one more and one more speaker.\nSpeaker 1: Lana, is Sheena.\nSpeaker 0: Misery Sheena.\nSpeaker 2: Good evening, Mayor and City Council. I also want to thank you for having this program in place. My father was the one who benefited from this program, and unfortunately he's not here. But if he were, he would have said the same thing. Thank you very much. This program is very important. And now that the city made changes to the city laws to protect the tenants, it is crucial to have this help because the law will be meaningless if there is nobody to implement it. And one thing I want to say in favor of De La Rosa is our personal experience with them. First of all, they're very knowledgeable about the issues on the island. They know the ordinance and know what's going on and they are available. There are other places like, say, for example, illegal. They're very good, but they are overwhelmed. And today, the housing situation is such that all this housing services, advocacy groups, they are tremendously overwhelmed. And tenants on the island have a resource like De La Raza. Then they have that resource available to them. Sorry. And that's number one. Number two, is that having that program in place facilitates settlements. Because anytime I used to do pro-bono advocacy in San Francisco years ago, and my experience with that was any time a tenant shows up to a court house with a lawyer, then usually 90% of the time they woke up settling. And this is one of the things that we need. And with the crisis, with the homeless crisis driving people out of their home, we really need this kind of help. So thank you very much. And I hope that you support this program and this program will continue.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Ms.. Recine. Okay. That's all of our public speakers. I'm actually going to lead off because I was one of the ones, and then I'll turn it over to you. Councilmember Desai and I wrote a long email this morning to Debbie Potter, and you did get back to me this evening. I support in concept the program and the having an agreement with Centro Legal de la Raza. My problem is with some of the amendments. So we know from the scope of services and from what the reason that the council voted in 2018 to allocate a half a million dollars, $500,000 over three years, $166,666 each year to El Centro to the center. The was to provide legal services to low income tenants to reduce the risk of displacement. And certainly those of us who work often in the housing arena and working hard to combat our housing crisis know that the best way to address homelessness is not to let it happen in the first place, and that's why things like the emergency funds are so helpful. But my concern with these proposed changes are threefold. One of them is Centro Legal has come back and said essentially after the first year, you know, we just didn't reach as many people as we thought we would. So pay us the same amount of money while we reduce the number of legal consultations by 5%, the number of clients served by 25%, legal representation by 50%, and providing housing stabilization strategies by 33%. And there is a proposal to include, over the course of two years, $55,000 of city money for this emergency financial assistance that we we heard Ms.. Porter speak about, which has up till now been provided by county funds. But those funds look like they're going to go away in May of this year. So certainly good to have the ability to supplant those. I feel that whenever we're taking money from the general fund, we want to make sure that it's well spent. And as an attorney, not actively practicing now, but if I were bidding on a contract for services, I would be looking at the number of clients we expected to serve, the number of attorneys, paralegals, staff, time it takes . But now, with this reduction in still wanting to be paid the same amount, I I'm I'm uncomfortable with that. But another concern I had in reading your annual report is that Centro Legal has no Asian language proficiency. In fact, they stated that in their first year they learned from outreach that Alameda has a high. Relation high Asian population, many of whom are non-English speaking well around Alameda. It's a pretty well-known fact that our population is anywhere from 33%, maybe even higher. Asian Pacific Islanders. And I was surprised to read that Central. They didn't know that until they did their initial outreach. And then in the the annual report, it was stated that additional funding beyond current contract amounts would be required to conduct a needs assessment for those communities, the Asian Speaking Communities to determine best program designed to address their specific legal needs and elsewhere. It said in the report that. But, you know, we can probably just deal with them using a translator over the phone. That bothers me, because for English speaking and probably Spanish speaking clients, they would get a person to person consultation. But if you're Asian speaking, you're going to be talking over the phone with a translator. I just think you're very vulnerable, as are two tenant representative. And as mentioned, you're very vulnerable. And so we want to make sure we're giving you the best representation possible. My modification to this agreement would be okay if you're going to keep the $500,000 over three years, but you're telling us already you're serving less clients. I would expect central legal to bring in Asian speaking interpreters to actually I mean, who are trained to actually work with folks rather than saying, oh, you can just use our phone translation service, that that's unacceptable for me. And then the third concern I have is the clinic locations and hours are not helpful for working people and those with limited mobility. So in the staff report, we read that legal consultation services at Central Legal's location are just over the Fruitvale Bridge. And those services are provided again in the Fruitvale District every Tuesday at 9 a.m.. If you were on a weekly basis or once a month at Mastic, which is in Alameda from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m.. Well, in my email to Ms.. Potter, I said that formula is backwards. Central Legal should be in Alameda once a week. And I would propose I don't want to micromanage, but I would propose at a set location whether it's the first Tuesday, the month that mastic, the second Tuesday at our midpoint collaborative the third at the library that you should serve Alameda residents in Alameda because not everyone is able to hop on the bus there and get there. There are there are, you know, physical limitations sometimes. But also the fact that the clinics and the services are only offered weekday mornings is troublesome because for working people, you wouldn't be able to I mean, many working people would not be able to take time off to go and seek this legal consultation. And so, as I said, that, you know, legal representation is only effective if you can access it. So I and I know Ms.. Potter, when she responded, said that, well, they tried and they just didn't get much response at their clinics in Alameda, but now they're proposing to do more outreach. So I would say in that outreach, tell people that you'll be in Alameda every week. And secondly, it was stated that, well, you know, they do a lot of phone consultations and find that those are sufficient. Well, phone consultations for half a million dollars for three years, that that seems kind of steep to me. So I want to provide this legal representation, but I want it to be effective. And so, again, for the reasons that I've stated, unless we can make modifications, I can't support this in Councilmember de SAC. I know you also wanted to pull this item.\nSpeaker 6: Well, thank you. I just have some questions. Perhaps staff can respond or or the service provider. So my questions are as follows In what way does the service provider ensure that it is pursuing only those legal cases after examining both renter and land small landlords perspective? In other words, next question How does the service provider guard against situations where they are, where they are not getting the full picture from a client? I mean, what are what are the internal procedures in place? Policies, procedures that make sure that they get the full picture.\nSpeaker 10: So central legal. Their first recourse, essentially, or their first approach is to to talk with both the landlord and the tenant and see if they can negotiate a resolution and to not have that the issue at hand end up in court. And they did inform me that they have not yet initiated a single litigation against a single landlord in Alameda, but rather they've been very effective working to negotiate solutions without the need to the recourse of going to court so that as part of that process, there is a fact finding process where they are able to speak with both the landlord and the tenant and then evaluate the veracity of what both sides are saying. So that's their process, and they have not yet brought any litigation against any landlord.\nSpeaker 6: They have not brought any litigation against landlords, but they have written letters to landlords. Is that correct? On behalf of tenants?\nSpeaker 10: I'm. Yes, they yes, they have. And.\nSpeaker 0: You know, will it be necessary? Would it be helpful? Are you saying the same thing I was?\nSpeaker 2: Yes, go ahead.\nSpeaker 1: Good evening. Council Mayor Ashcraft. Yes.\nSpeaker 0: So if you want to introduce yourself. Oh.\nSpeaker 1: Sorry. My name is Monique Berlanga. I'm the directing attorney of the tenants rights practice at Centro Legal de la Rosa. And I want to thank everybody for the questions. These are all very good questions, things that we've been examining internally as well in terms of how we are delivering services under the program. In response to your specific question about how do we make sure that.\nSpeaker 6: Yeah, if you have internal procedures or policies that institutionalizing the fact finding phase? Sure. I am aware of some small landlords who just received a letter that kind of took their presumptive position that. The landlord was wrong. Yes. Without having. Really? Interviewed the landlord or gathered the facts.\nSpeaker 1: So I would say that there are there are different levels of services we provide. We often at our clinics provide consultation services. We can help tenants who may not be able to write letters themselves, write letters to their landlords. But that's different from when we enter into a legal representation. When we enter into a legal representation and retain a tenant for services, we're definitely going to investigate the facts before we agree to provide any type of litigation related or long, longer extended services. So I hope that answers your questions. But in a brief drop in clinic, often, you know, we don't have that opportunity.\nSpeaker 6: I think. The thing that I would encourage is that, um, perhaps as that you create internal policies and procedures that if you're communicating with whomever, that you indicate that this is not a leak, you know, this is not, as you said, a legal situation. Um, a so that when a landlord gets a letter, they understand that while it might come from, from your organization or with the assistance of staff from your organization, that there is a difference between. This is a legal letter that says, hey, you've done something wrong and we're going to try to fix it through the courts. And that there's a process by which it is clearly indicated that that this is. I know this is a non-legal or information gathering phase. Sure. Yeah. Um, because I have, I do know of landlords who have received letters and who felt like what you know. I think the bigger picture is they felt like they were the big picture. Their perspective was not taken into account. Yeah. Um, so, um. That that's what I would encourage. Is that, um. That you'd be more clear because, you know, there are small landlords in town for whom it is difficult to wage their own legal case. It's not like everyone has, you know, a bundle of money to pay lawyers. So I think a little sensitivity on that part is.\nSpeaker 1: So so one other thing I'd like to mention in terms of our model and and what we do for tenants, which kind of goes hand-in-hand with the modifications we're proposing tonight, is we really pride ourselves in intervening early before a situation gets to the point of eviction, which is why we are proposing a reduced number of eviction , defense representations and more informational tenant education outreach efforts. A lot of what I'm finding when I go to Mastic and I conduct these clinics is tenants coming in and saying, Can you help me interpret my lease? Or I'm starting to have this issue. How can I de-escalate this issue with my landlord? What are some options I may have? What are my rights? Their rights? And we're able to intervene early at that stage or refer them to the rent board for mediation or whatever it may be. So I would say that that's that's where we're trying to focus at this point, is more collaborative efforts. But then again, we do have duties to clients to to enforce their rights and to help them provide notice as provided by the law. So I hear I hear what you're saying. And we do take we are very, very careful before we enter into a full legal representation to make sure we invest all the facts, investigate all the facts. But it does put us in a little bit of a difficult situation when we do have to often take attendance words for what their experiences.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: So I see this woman. You would. Would you like. Are you also from Central Park?\nSpeaker 1: Because my colleagues are.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. So is that where you're standing up to be supportive or did you want to speak? You know, if you're going to speak and please speak into the microphone and introduce yourself, please.\nSpeaker 2: Sure. I'm Katie Guimond.\nSpeaker 0: I'm going to need to look closer.\nSpeaker 2: Yes, I'm Katie Guimond. I'm ah, research and policy analyst at Central Go. And I just wanted to make sure that I'm available for questions. I didn't have anything specific on this matter.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Okay. And then I do have a question from Councilmember Vella.\nSpeaker 1: Do you think it's just to stay up or.\nSpeaker 0: I don't know. It depends on the question. Is it discretionary question?\nSpeaker 9: Both.\nSpeaker 0: So okay.\nSpeaker 9: So I hear my colleague's concern regarding the language issues I used to be when I started my legal career I worked in for a nonprofit law firm. I think that it's always difficult to find the balance between the informational sessions versus the, you know, the one on one client time. I am wondering if maybe there's a way to create some sort of program to do a by appointment in Alameda where you can schedule with the language line, that sort of thing, or get an interpreter available once you've made arrangements. And I think that that might meet the needs of, you know, having the drop in hours, but also having a space within that area or working with staff to find a space where you could have meetings in Alameda with clients so that they don't have to go off island with.\nSpeaker 0: With respect, if you're referring to my concern with an interpreter on the line, I know that that would not satisfy my my concerns. So I would like an in-person.\nSpeaker 9: Well, I'm saying that it would allow them. My question is whether they could make arrangements to allow sometimes you can't get an interpreter to physically come in depending on the language or the dialect or language. Sometimes you have to make arrangements to have a call in. But if there's a space, I think one of your other concerns was having, you know, accessibility for people in Alameda. And my question was, if there's a way to kind of carve out space for these one on one meetings, also potentially in Alameda where people can schedule, because I hear the concern also regarding the times, but sometimes it's a matter of making yourself available for a scheduled appointment. And I know people often don't like to go to the to the drop in hours because they don't know if they're going to have to wait to see somebody and that sort of thing. And so if there's a process that they can go about scheduling that and schedule it, perhaps here in Alameda as opposed to going to the offices, and they can make arrangements for any sort of language if they have a language preference, that sort of thing. And what that would look like, what you do for other contracts where you have language barriers.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I think that's a great idea. I think so. Speaking of other contracts, we administer several different entities, placement contracts in other jurisdictions. And as this this contract is evolving, our other contracts are evolving similarly as well. Things start in pilot and as you learn to see a community's needs, you're often modifying as you go. I would I think that's a great idea. In terms of the appointments, I don't think it would be a great use of our resources to have weekly drop in clinics necessarily. I don't I think an appointment based system would work pretty well, particularly given the timelines we're dealing with. A three day notice is a tenant may not be able to wait till the next drop in clinic. And what do they do? They call us and that is what we end up often doing, is making an individual appointment with them or, you know, giving them the advice over phone. Or if a tenant has an unlawful detainer, they have a five day response time, you know, having a set day. There will always be tenants who need services in the interim. And I think we are definitely open to some to a model like that where we are doing phone consultations but then setting up blocks of time within Alameda to meet with tenants face to face where we can if we have, you know, a volunteer interpreter potentially or an interpreter, we hire in a certain dialect present, but if not, then we can use the language line. I wish we could have staff who speak every dialect and every language that's available in Alameda. I don't know. You know, we can we can reach out to our banks for clarification.\nSpeaker 0: I did not ask that. Oh, no.\nSpeaker 1: No, no. I know that.\nSpeaker 0: It was Chinese specifically. And I'm not asking for interpreters for every language spoken in Alameda.\nSpeaker 1: Even within Chinese, though, we find that there are many different dialects.\nSpeaker 0: I think my colleague had some good suggestions.\nSpeaker 1: Definitely. I think that's something we're open to. And we, you know, we are also are open to talking with every council member about what their ideas might be for different locations, different sites, different groups. We can reach out to. We are. We're happy to spend as much time on the island as works for tenants. That's why we've proposed to outreach community engagement. We want people to know we're here or services are available. We'd like to come out to community groups and do outreach education workshops. Those type of services definitely broke into.\nSpeaker 0: Councilmember villages to have the floor.\nSpeaker 9: And then a couple other things I think working with. We do have a tenants group working with them. I think it is important to have drop in some some drop in hours scheduled, maybe not every week, but coordinating with them. They have monthly meetings and things like that. So perhaps you can coordinate with them to get the word out about it or with the housing authority as well. I think it's helpful to have that available to folks. And then there is the other question I had is your materials make? Are they do we have them in some of the known languages here in Alameda that there have been requests, some of the standard informational letters or fax, getting it translated in to Mandarin or Cantonese or other dialects that we know. We have a large population with the need.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. We've in the budget modification attached to the annual report we have in excuse me, requested increased outreach materials funding so that we can contract for translation and.\nSpeaker 9: So that but that specific to getting translated materials and fake use.\nSpeaker 1: Absolutely. That that would be that would be a use of this.\nSpeaker 9: Okay. And then, you know, just and I know we have a diverse group of opinions up here. I certainly appreciate the fact that you're contracting with us to preserve to to provide a certain amount of advocacy for a specific group. And so sometimes that means sending out letters where you're acting as the representative of that individual, where they might feel like they don't have a voice. You're giving them that voice. And I think that's a very important role that you're playing. And that's personally why I'm very supportive of this contract and the services that are provided. I think it's it's necessary. And oftentimes it does bring people to the table to prevent further stress on on either side and make sure that everybody is abiding by the laws and ordinances that we've set forth in the protections to make sure that it's a level playing field. So I know that you've provided that service, and I thank you for that.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Who's next? Councilman Brody.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you. Again, thanks for providing the service. I just want to make sure we're clear that, you know, your services are legal services and they're governed by the business and professions code. Right? So attorneys are by nature and by law, you know, not the finder of fact. When there's a dispute in facts. And just because there's a dispute doesn't mean the landlord is right. So your job is to represent the tenants and be their advocate. And if there is a dispute, that could end up going to a court. So it's not the job of you all to decide, you know, who's right, who's wrong. It's to zealously zealously advocate for your client, right?\nSpeaker 1: That is correct. And we take that duty very seriously.\nSpeaker 4: So I just want to make sure nobody expects that if you go to get an advocate for you, that they're going to end up, you know, proving the the other side's position. So, I mean, I look at the numbers, what, 62. So if 14% were API, that's nine, right? So do we know the languages of these nine nine folks that we're classifying? Well, we serve 60 to 62 people. Right.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Are you an exhibit?\nSpeaker 4: I think I'm in the.\nSpeaker 0: Did you read the report? Okay.\nSpeaker 4: We served 60 to 60 legal consultations, five four scope representations, total of 62 and duplicated clients. 14% were API. It is that so that.\nSpeaker 1: I don't have those numbers in front of me in terms of language?\nSpeaker 4: I guess I'd be curious to know because I mean, are four big AAPI groups, Chinese, Filipino, Vietnamese, and I think Korean is next. So I mean, there's not a tremendous number of languages that you need to have people available on. And it does kind of bother me that, you know, almost 10% of the folks that are four, 15%, one in seven that come to you, you know, may not speak the language. And that you know, I mean, when the mayor pointed it out, we're actually getting less for the same amount of money. And now we have to pay for this, in addition, which seems to be kind of a deficiency in the current arrangement, it seems to me that you might be able to work with us on that. And, you know, maybe, you know, on the second point, you know, maybe coming every week is not feasible for you. But, you know, there has to be something maybe in the middle. I mean, can you address some of the the things that the mayor had a concern on and maybe tell us some of those that you might be able to, you know, to help us with? Yeah, but I am concerned about the language. I mean.\nSpeaker 1: We're looking those numbers up right now so we can tell you what percentage.\nSpeaker 0: And while you're looking those numbers up, I would just add I was making notes in the margin that I don't know. I mean, we could help connect you with members of our Asian API community. I'm thinking of Alice Ly Becher, a former community county supervisor who's very well besides being native born, you know, from Hong Kong herself . But she's, she's a fluent speaker and she's very tied in with the AAPI community. There are many others too, who because I just fear that there's the numbers you serve. But there might have even been more that had the need. But they didn't know if you didn't have materials in their languages. So I thank you, Councilmember Odie, for highlighting that.\nSpeaker 4: I mean, I mean, are, you know, one of our elected officials Filipino. Another one is is Chinese. There's the Asian Law Caucus. I mean, there's a number of resources that, you know, you could presumably find a translator that wouldn't charge, you know. Over the roof or whatever the term is?\nSpeaker 1: Oh, definitely. And I want to clarify that. I don't think it's been a problem for us in our service provision of providing services in LA, in other languages. My concern is I think there are communities who don't know about the availability of our services, which is where these types of connections which we hope that you all can help us with. And you know, as you mentioned, we do have many partner agencies who can help us with the translation of materials. But our number one concern has been is focusing our efforts into those communities in trying to, in a cultural, culturally responsive way of letting them know that there are rights that exist and that we are here for them. And, you know, this is a constant struggle we do in every community that we work with a finding where the most marginalized and vulnerable communities and how can we make inroads into reaching them. So, you know, we can provide you the information. But my concern is that people that haven't come to us. Mm hmm.\nSpeaker 4: Still, I mean.\nSpeaker 1: You want me to speak to the. Oh, yes.\nSpeaker 4: Some of the things that the may or may have. And I didn't hear you address that. Some of those could be resolved.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, absolutely. So the decrease in deliverables, I will say when we designed this, our initial proposal to the city for this contract, we looked at it and we said, okay, one attorney, you know, some portion of a paralegal, what is the maximum caseload that one attorney can carry in terms of eviction, defense? I believe we proposed 40 reps because that's kind of the responsible caseload for an eviction defense attorney. In piloting the project, we've learned that that's not the primary need in Alameda, that the primary need that we've been seen is consultation services, no people wanting clarifications about the law, people not knowing what their rights are. So we've proposed to modify, to increase our efforts there to, you know, focus more on outreach, on the tenant education, on the consultation services, trying to make inroads within the community as opposed to having kind of an arbitrary number of eviction defense cases. We want to prevent evictions. We want to provide the whole spectrum of services, not just eviction, defense, when a case has gotten to the point where there is no amicable resolution without, you know, a judge intervening, which goes along with the EFA services as well, that, you know, helps prevent evictions. So I was.\nSpeaker 0: Like, no, I was just going to say, because you translate the acronym for people who don't know what that is, the EFA.\nSpeaker 1: Yes, emergency financial assistance. So so we're not really viewing this as offering fewer services. We're viewing this as modifying existing services to meet the needs that we are finding that the community is presenting, that showing us that they need. You know, if you want us to focus only on eviction defense, you know, we could potentially do that. But we're finding in all of all of the jurisdictions we're working in, that having the broader range of services is the best way to combat displacement.\nSpeaker 4: I think the to correct me if I'm wrong, Mayor, but I think the two items that the mayor raised were, you know, the language availability and having to pay for that. And then, you know, the hours that being not convenient for people who live here and may also add on on language. I know we have a lot of folks that, you know, from East Africa or that speak Arabic languages and that's that's a growing population. Yes. In our city. So we need to be cognizant of that, those languages as well.\nSpeaker 1: Absolutely. And, you know, again, we use our language line. It's not a perfect solution, but we do serve clients from all in. I think right now I just saw our most recent bill for our language line translation. I think we had maybe 15 different languages that we are actively providing services to clients not just in the city of Alameda but throughout central legal and it is effective in court. You know, there's been recent case law where the court must provide an interpreter in court proceedings. But interpretation is expensive, you know, to have in-person interpretation. But it is it is important. And, you know, again, we do have partnerships with other organizations where if if the need was presented, if we want to do a know your rights presentation and other language, we do have some partners we can draw upon to assist us with. But again, any any partners you can connect us with. Do you appreciated in terms of. Oh, sorry.\nSpeaker 4: And her answer. Yeah.\nSpeaker 1: So we, we've, we've looked at the numbers for languages.\nSpeaker 5: Yeah. So I just wanted to share that of the people we've served.\nSpeaker 2: One person told us that they speak Chinese, Cantonese. Specifically, one person said.\nSpeaker 5: That they speak to speak Tagalog specifically.\nSpeaker 2: And the rest were English, French and Spanish with a few people who did not report the language.\nSpeaker 4: So it's for two. Maybe we shouldn't be built.\nSpeaker 2: The way.\nSpeaker 4: It seems if it's only two. Maybe we shouldn't be billed extra.\nSpeaker 1: But we're not. We're not. We're not building extra that we do. We? That was just part of the contract.\nSpeaker 0: Well, we haven't even agreed on what we're going to approve as far as funding for next year. So I you know what? I have got to wrap up really quickly. So you're going to say that the vice mayor would like to make his comments?\nSpeaker 1: I'm just going to say, in terms of clinics and ours, you know, again, that that's a constant and we're open to suggestions or ideas. I think an appointment based system would be really great where we can do an initial intake by phone and set up an appointment based on the attendance hours, what works for them in the city of Alameda, which we we do. We are doing that right now. That wasn't highlighted in the report, but that is something we are actively doing. And we have evening clinics as well, which I have noticed that.\nSpeaker 0: Is that in the report?\nSpeaker 1: Where was that? Yeah, that's just something we do. We work actually with the law school. So we have UC.\nSpeaker 0: Berkeley and you have evening clinics in Oakland.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, we do. And I'll tell you what, alameda tenants have been coming to this alameda me the hours.\nSpeaker 0: You know alameda tenants have been coming but you can't count the ones who didn't come. And Councilmember Odie referenced people from Middle Eastern Arabic speaking countries. Some of those women who are veiled will not get on a bus and go over to Oakland by themselves. And so it's part of being culturally sensitive. Let's hear from the vice mayor.\nSpeaker 7: I'm sorry. Thank you. So I actually before you before you leave, I just what I want to just clarify my my understanding when I look at your budget. So so you you had a you had a goal of a 125 connections last year. And now this year, we're we're going to we're going to drop that to 75. But ultimately, in the end, if I if I'm reading the report, right. You actually spoke to 62 people. Is that is that correct? So, so and the exact numbers aren't that important, but I just want to make sure that's that general understanding.\nSpeaker 1: That's the general budget.\nSpeaker 7: And so this revised budget, really what you're proposing here is that you're going to do more outreach and for less money going to legal representation, you're going to you're still going to you're assuming you're still going to provide services to a greater number of people.\nSpeaker 1: Absolutely. There will be more touches. We think the impact will actually be greater as we're out there giving presentations, providing that knowledge into the community, empowering the community to provide that knowledge to their, you know, friends, neighbors, family. So we do think that this will be actually a much greater impact by reallocate reallocating families.\nSpeaker 7: So I appreciate the thoughtfulness that goes that went into this. So when I've been in your shoes talking to boards of diocese and these are never phone conversations, so thank you for your for your willingness to engage. My question is because I because I do agree that I mean, you know, when you live in a town where the ethnic makeup is 30% Chinese-American and somebody who and we've all knocked on doors as we're going around, knows that there are a lot of households out there that that there is knowing it's not even just, you know, low, low English proficiency, but but zero. I do think that that's a that's an issue that I would want to make sure is clarified if and as we move forward, how that is going to be handled both from the is, you know, I guess my question is this is this enough money for outreach, quite honestly, because it feels like printing some fliers and then dropping them off in some places and hoping people hoping people find them. So I might actually be interested in seeing if there's a slightly larger outreach in education budget that could could be used to reach some of the communities that were not current that that you've highlighted, that you're concerned you're not reaching into. Again, I don't know what that right number is or in this may be it, I'm open to that. But I would also like to better understand how, to my colleagues point that if and when we move forward with with the contract, how we can utilize city resources and whatever else to have onsite in city meetings. Yeah. I mean one of the good things about living next door to a really large city is that you have access to lots of resources that you might not if everybody was just the size of Alameda. On the other hand, sometimes there's this expectation that everybody leave the island in order to get services. And I am sensitive to especially the populations for. I can do here may not be the populations that have the flexibility, the time and whatnot to necessarily get in a car, drive and jump on a bus and spend 30 or 40 minutes traveling to a meeting. So I'd like to kind of see that addressed as we're moving forward in this conversation.\nSpeaker 0: Councilmember Vela.\nSpeaker 9: Yeah, I think there are, uh, you know, if there's a way to partner with some of these surrounding organizations, there are some that are actually active. They're based in Oakland as well, but active here in Alameda. Filipino Advocates for justice. Um, Asian Health Services. And some of those groups where, where perhaps it's not doing the drop in hours or something like that but actually doing a know your rights event co-sponsored with those groups where you could have breakouts in various languages and doing something like that where you're pooling resources to make it more effective and doing it maybe once or twice a year just to give the updates if there have been any updates to let people know what your work is. I'd love to see something like that. Co-sponsored with Alameda Renters and these other groups that are operating here. I think as much as we can pool resources among the different nonprofits that are doing the work, as well as our legal nonprofits and our our activists to help get the word out. Then you have multiple people in multiple platforms helping with the publicity. It's not then an added budget expense and we can really coalesce and um, rather than duplicate. So I think that, you know, if we could see that and have some plan for that, whether from a staff perspective, I know that that's something that you and Debbie mentioned in your kind of report. There was an email that you sent clearing up some information. And I know we've talked about, uh, these sort of possibilities.\nSpeaker 10: And the perfect example of a know your rights that you co-sponsor is that I have referred when the Chans office wants to do a know your rights event in April, and I have referred them to Centro Legal to combine their forces and do something collaboratively. So we're not having multiple events so we can get more bang. And the housing authority is working with central legal for a know your rights forum. So I think that that is exactly the kind of thing that's being looked at as part of the outreach and the enhanced outreach budget. Um.\nSpeaker 0: Well, finish your sentence and then I want to, I want to suggest a modification.\nSpeaker 10: And then I was, I was going to, if I, if it's helpful, I was just going to summarize a few of the key points that I heard this evening, which was on the interpret the interpreters. So, um, Centro uses the language, Centro uses a language line which we don't pay extra for. I mean that's part of the services and the language line. They, they do meet with a person in the room and then the translators on the phone so that they're with the client in person. And what I've heard is that the council might like to see a model where there is an initial contact and then a one on one appointment is scheduled with a time, and then arrangements can be made for an interpreter to be physically present. If, um, if that's what's warranted as a next step. I mean, it sounded like that there's either the language line or to try to identify somebody who could do interpretation.\nSpeaker 0: Um, so I'll answer that. Although Council, I'm going to need your indulgence for about two more minutes when my time runs out. But, um, I, I have maybe softened on an interpreter, but if the, uh, the tenant says no, I would really like someone in person translating, I think that that person could be found. What I can't agree to is adding to this budget to provide more services, more outreach. Translation I think this budget has all that is needed. I know I read that whether you could do more outreach, but it would take more funds. You have stated that they're doing less legal representation, more tenant education. So that's non attorney time. So I would I, I think this this contract is plenty rich in terms of compensation, especially for touching fewer clients.\nSpeaker 10: Asking for any additional compensation that the recommendation is a revised work scope with the existing the existing budget. So there's no request for additional funding from the city council.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Notwithstanding what was said in the in the annual report.\nSpeaker 10: Well, the point that was being made in the annual report was less about the translation and more about the cultural competency. And if the central legal were to do a deeper. I've around cultural competency that that was an exercise that would require additional funding. And what they said was, however, and we're not asking for that additional funding, they were just pointing out that cultural competency is a different than just translation services. But what they're proposing is, as they do their their more robust outreach, they will be able to do some of what was being suggested tonight, such as reaching out to Alice Liberty or the and other folks who may have connections in the community that can help with that, but not for any additional funding for that exercise. That's not what's being requested. There is no additional funding being requested this evening.\nSpeaker 0: Council Could I have a motion to give me maximum three more minutes on this item?\nSpeaker 3: Um. Sure.\nSpeaker 6: Um. Yeah, I'll move that second.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. All in favor. I. Okay. Thank you. Okay. So, um, I. So I take a few steps back, and again, I am stunned that an organization as well-regarded, incompetent as Central ago did not know that working in Alameda would involve working with Asian speaking, non-English speaking Asian clients. And so now they're having to do, you know, go back and make up for lost time. I'm saying that should have been part of the first phase in year one. So whatever they need to do to increase that cultural competency and there have been great suggestions from my colleagues about you don't have to reinvent the wheel. Asian health services, other you know organizations partner with other groups. But I, I feel strongly about they should do more to to do more robust outreach. But again, within that same funding envelope. And I if I'm going to vote for this proposal, I do need to see more time spent in Alameda for all the reasons that have been articulated and the um, because again, at the end of the day, what we're trying to do is keep people from being displaced. And we're hearing from our tenants that now that tenants have a little more confidence or less fear to come forward and complain about habitability requirements. It's already a struggle. People are working two and three jobs just to pay the rent. Let's not make them take time out of their busy days to go to Oakland. I think you know, you're serving Alameda. I think you should spend as much time here as you're spending in Oakland at clinics. My thoughts? Okay. Who's next? Councilmember. Councilmember Diaz.\nSpeaker 6: Well, thank you. I just want to make two points. First is, from a practical standpoint, the reason why we want to have more services provided in the city of Alameda is because from a practical perspective, we don't know if our if our funds. Are paying for clients from San Leandro or Oakland when they go to your Oakland office. So at least if we're in Alameda, we know that they're Alameda. So we know something about the way in which our funds are being expended. Perhaps there's an answer to that that you have. But but that's that's one of the practical reasons why if we're going to fund services, that the services ought to be in the city in which, you know, the funds are coming from. Um, the second point is, um, I certainly, uh, I want to hear more and maybe it's not for tonight, but I just want to hear more about how your organization can guard against situations, um, where you're not getting the full picture. Um, and. I certainly heard the. Part that you said that there's a clear distinction between legal representation, in which case you have to, as Councilmember Brody says, defend your client to the fullest. But I think I also heard that before you get to this phase of legal representation, there's also some information gathering that that that you do with the tenants. I think it's at that point where I would want somehow that that, you know, you also are gathering information from the small, small mom and pop landlords. That's that's who I represent. And, you know, those are the perspectives that I hear and. And you know, maybe in this day and age, you know, it's not a politically correct thing to say, but it is what it is. And so that's that's what I want to hear, is that that there is a process by which, you know, you have internal procedures in place that that ensure that that you're doing all that you can in following your procedures to get the full picture of a certain situation before you take it to the next stage of of it being some kind of legal issue, at which point in time, yes. Council Member Ody is correct. You have to represent, you know, your client as best as possible. Not all landlords are right. Not all renters are right. You know, there's a gray area somewhere in there. And as professionals, you know, we have to figure that out. So those are the two points that I want to say. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilmember Odie.\nSpeaker 4: I guess my question was to our councilman. What, if anything, can we modify in this agreement here? Like could we require a check in in 90 days to, you know, implement some of the things that we've we've asked about? Could we require, you know, 5050 splitting of the of the meetings or, you know, as the mayor or flip it, like the mayor suggested? I mean, what type of things can we modify?\nSpeaker 7: These are all things you can modify, though the other side might have a saying yes or no as to whether or not they'll sign the agreement.\nSpeaker 4: Well, I'm not comfortable waiting a year. Yeah, but maybe there's some middle ground. I don't know.\nSpeaker 10: I mean, the item is before you tonight, and you can amend the work scope and just just I just want to address Councilmember De Sykes at one point. We absolutely know that we are serving and paying for services delivered to Alameda residents. There is an intake form that is done and the central league, our work, our contract requires reporting. So we absolutely know that we are serving Alameda residents with the city's money. So I just want to make that clear.\nSpeaker 6: Appreciate it. Thank you.\nSpeaker 10: I was. I was. It sounds like the council might be interested in having the work scope further amended, which if we get directions, staff can do that so that we pursue the one on one appointments. And that I think what we heard from Central Legal this evening is that the the the drop in clinics more than monthly at mastic the know your rights events which are already contemplated are effective but that the one on one appointments may be the most effective way to to work with Alameda residents so that when they can be scheduled and they can have a block of time and they can schedule one on one appointments, we can absolutely provide space for them to conduct these meetings. We I think we should be able to do that. And then I think we can modify the work scope to include that. And then I would you had suggested 90 days. I was thinking about a six month check in back to the council where we could communicate, you know, a six month report check in. We can either do it as an off agenda or if the council wanted a presentation from from central legal staff, we could do that. And that might be a way to track how things are going and that they would be doing more outreach and work with translating materials. Those kinds of things are already contemplated in the work scope. And so it sounded like one of the bigger changes was the one on one appointments here in Alameda.\nSpeaker 0: I would add to that, I think I've said it a couple of times. I want to see more robust outreach to non-English speaking communities and then, uh, let's see, did someone else want to chime in? I just lost my train of thought to try and get it back at Councilmember Avila.\nSpeaker 9: I think one other thing is with or we're doing a rent registry right now, so we're going to have addresses and more information, correct. I think somehow utilizing that information or in anything that goes out from the city, including Centro's information on it, that has to happen. I know there was a delay in having that happen before, and that was on our end. And I would like to make sure that that that that is part and parcel of it, that we are also doing our our job and getting the word out about these services being available. And that not only do we note that that Centro is a resource for for tenants to call, but also that that perhaps we do that in a couple of different languages so that are our tenants who speak different languages and especially languages that we know are prevalent, that they can call Centro and that language services are available to them. So they will get they will get legal services that this is not only for English speakers. So I think that that's something that we can do on our end. And certainly we need to make sure that we're doing that because that's part of the outreach.\nSpeaker 0: And I'll just say there's already a line item in in their annual report for outreach and marketing. So this should be well within the scope. And what I was also going to add is this emergency financial assistance recommending $25,000 allocation the year in year to 30,000 in year three. But yet in the first year of the grant city of Alameda, tenants received $47,462 in CFA grants. So why would we then reduce that amount? This is where I would feel more comfortable just holding back some of the $166,666 for the city. And to say, okay, you do the you find out who needs this assistance, let us know what you'd have to do anyway, because we have to have ultimate approval authority. And I mean, why would we only authorize 25,000 in emergency assistance this year when last year they allocated 47,000, I would say is the need getting smaller?\nSpeaker 10: Well, last year out of this budget there was no right.\nSpeaker 0: I understand. Understood, Ms.. Potter. But again, it's the same money we're talking the same funds that we're talking about. Emergency financial assistance to keep people from slipping through the cracks. So it's looking like the city will take that over now. And I'm just saying, why allocate less for this next year than was spent last year?\nSpeaker 10: Well, because they've been because tenants have been able to access the county money from last November through May. The county contracts still in place. It's an augmentation now. And then if the county contract is not renewed come May, then there's the 30,000 for the following year. And it may be that one of the report backs to council can be what the county did with the contract in May to understand whether or not it's going to be a reduction or not.\nSpeaker 0: I'm just reading from the annual report that says in the first year of the grant city of Alameda, tenants have received 47,000, etc..\nSpeaker 10: That's correct. That's correct. From the County Funds Council.\nSpeaker 0: Councilmember Odie.\nSpeaker 4: Let me try something. So I'd like to move approval of the item with the understanding that staff comes back in four months because six months is on break. And then so that really that means seven. So I don't think that's feasible with hearing all of the concerns that were raised today and then seeing if you could come up with some agreement or modifications we could consider at that point to amend the agreement based on, you know, further research and negotiation.\nSpeaker 9: If needed.\nSpeaker 4: If needed. I don't know. We'll see if that fly. You can always.\nSpeaker 0: Extend that again.\nSpeaker 4: Well, rather than change anything today, just come back in four months, because I'm sure everyone has heard everything that we've we've talked about. And then see if you can come up with different ways to amend the agreement in four months time that could help alleviate all these concerns. At no additional cost.\nSpeaker 0: So based on council comments. Right?\nSpeaker 4: Right. Yeah. I mean, that way we keep moving forward and we don't let it lapse or anything, but we get a sooner reaction to some of these these things because I don't like the idea of amending from the dais, but, you know, I'm open to it if my colleagues have something firm that they they think the legal services group can agree to, but just it's emotion. We'll see what.\nSpeaker 2: Happens.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. We've had a motion. We've had a second discussion. Vice Mayor That's right.\nSpeaker 7: Yeah. So my biggest concern is four months isn't very much in time to get something here. We're going to have two months of data. I don't I don't I much as I don't want to wait until September, I really think that we should give them till September so that we can actually get some time, some time for them to to do something that they're going to be turning around. A report starting in about a month without time to have actually done anything that we're that we're looking to address. I'm fully supportive with the general motion. I would also just want to give a little bit, make sure that there's clarity on what things we're reporting back on, which in terms of in my mind is the in language, the how meetings are going and how outreach is happening and how successful that outreach has been.\nSpeaker 0: So are you making a substitute motion?\nSpeaker 7: I guess I'm asking Councilmember Ody if he would be willing to accept that.\nSpeaker 4: I mean, maybe if we can get it before the end of July. But, you know, it shouldn't take that much time to report out on the outreach efforts that are being done. It shouldn't take that much time to figure out which languages they need, you know, supported. And I mean, I don't know. I guess that's a question. So whether, you know, we give away X hundred dollars for assistance or we have, you know, 30 cases versus 60, I agree that we're not going to have that data, but I think there were some specific points that were raised specifically around meeting in Alameda and interpreting services that I don't know if you need data on. But, you know.\nSpeaker 0: Councilmember Bell is going to clear this all that person.\nSpeaker 2: No pressure.\nSpeaker 0: No pressure.\nSpeaker 9: I'm wondering if we can get an off if if we can get an off agenda report back before before in four months and then have an A have this come back on agenda after the break in September. And I think that that that will keep us on track to have that report in time for September. And if there's if there's updates or information that comes in, it'll be it'll come in in time. For a report from staff to be developed, and it will give us an opportunity to weigh in. And if there's more information that we're seeking or more details. So perhaps it's we can amend the motion to have an off off off agenda report back and in four months and then have this agenda is to come back to us in September.\nSpeaker 0: How does that sound to you? Councilor Roby Okay, so we have a modified motion that's been seconded.\nSpeaker 9: Second.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Yes. Sunbae, can somebody say goodbye? Councilmember Vel, any further discussion? All in favor. I oppose. Abstain, said the motion passes four in favor and one abstention.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you very much. Thank you, everyone, for all the information you provided. At this time, we're going to take about a ten minute break. We will resume at 830. Thank you. 30. Okay. The council meeting is resuming. I get that. And you know.\nSpeaker 3: What?\nSpeaker 0: Oh, okay. I'll take that. Okay, so we are resuming, but we're going to do a little bit of. How could I ask everyone? Everyone. There would be everyone to please. If you wanted to have a conversation, do it in the hall. This council meeting is in session. Hello, everyone. Okay, so I've had a few requests about looking at the agenda. Order. Um, Madam Clerk, can you tell us you have the speaker's lists for all the different items that are still to be heard, which is to say the entire regular agenda. And it's 830. Which of them has the most speakers?\nSpeaker 1: Six, eight.\nSpeaker 0: Six, eight has five. Okay, well, why don't we start at the top of the alphabet with six? And then, um. Okay.\nSpeaker 1: Then six P has one and six F has two.\nSpeaker 0: Okay, that's pretty similar. So. Okay. We are starting with 6a6am and three. Oh, you know what? I want to I want to just announcement or just keep coming up, ladies. Um, I did have a request from staff that not all staff were agreeable to merging items six B and 60. So we are. And merging them and they going to be heard separately. See, that was easy. Okay. Six. Wow. Is this right? What? You guys are doing that to me again?\nSpeaker 5: No, it's it's normal place. And usually it's.\nSpeaker 1: It may just be a brighter group, right?\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Yeah. Okay. To. Okay. Okay. So could I have a motion, please, to separate items B and C, back to being individual items. So move second a second by a council member. Decide all in favor I any oppose. Abstain. Okay. Okay. So I misspoke. Powder. I am just going to have to move my chair because I can't stand that light. But keep talking.\nSpeaker 10: Okay. Good evening, mayor and council members. I'm Debbie Potter, the development director. And I am delighted to be here tonight to talk about the MRU with the East Bay Regional Park District for the Northwest Territory Regional Shoreline. And I'm even more delighted to have my coconspirator here, Amy Wooldridge, the Rec and Park Director.",

8 . paradoxically , despite lower overall survival in elderly with malignant melanoma , the rate of positive sentinel lymph nodes ( sln ) decreases with age3 , 9 - 11 . this observation remains unexplained but is likely related at least in part to atrophy of skin lymphatics that occur with age12 . given the differing clinical presentation , pathological characteristics , and heightened mortality rates of elderly melanoma patients , we aimed to compare disease characteristics and clinical outcomes of patients 70 years of age and older versus under 70 years old . we reviewed 610 patients with malignant melanoma requiring sln biopsy entered into a prospective sln database from mayo clinic arizona , treated from june 1997 to june 2010 . disease characteristics and clinical outcomes were compared between patients 70 yrs vs. < 70 yrs of age . subset analysis was performed with a breakdown between age groups of < 50 , 50 - 59 , 60 - 69 and > 70 , but the statistical power of this analysis was limited due to the smaller number of events in the groups . primary melanoma anatomic locations were divided in four locations : head and neck , lower extremity , trunk , and upper extremity . characteristics of the primary melanoma that were analyzed included : breslow 's depth , t - stage ( < 1 mm , 1 - 2 mm , 2.01 - 4 mm , > 4 mm ) , ulceration , tumor infiltrating lymphocytes ( til ) , preexisting nevus , angiolymphatic invasion , perineural invasion , and mitotic rate . disease outcome measures included type of recurrence ( local / in - transit , regional , systemic ) , time to recurrence , time to local / in - transit recurrence , disease - specific mortality , and overall mortality . continuous variables were compared between groups using two - sample independent samples t - tests . disease outcomes were plotted using kaplan - meier curves and compared between groups using cox proportional hazards models . the mean age in the < 70 years old group was 52.2 ( 14 - 69 ) . among the elderly group ( 70 yrs ) , the mean age was 77.3 ( 70 - 97 ) , there was a greater predominance of men , 153 ( 65% ) compare to those < 70 yrs , where men comprised 56% ( p=0.04 ) , table 1 . the location of melanomas was significantly different between the elderly and younger patients ( p<0.001 ) . the elderly patients had a higher proportion of head and neck melanomas ( 34% ) relative to the younger patients ( 19% ) , whose most prevalent site was the trunk ( 35% ) . elderly patients had thicker tumors , with 43% of elderly patients had a t3 or t4 melanoma compared to 23% in the non - elderly ( p<0.001 ) . patients with age 70 had a greater mean number of mitotic figures , 3.6/mm vs. 2.7/mm ( p=0.005 ) including a greater preponderance of lesions with a high mitotic rate > 5/mm ( 29% vs 17% , p=0.003 . tumors in the elderly were less likely to arise from a pre - existing nevus , 17% vs. 36% ( p=0.003 ) . overall , the prevalence of sln metastases was similar between elderly and non - elderly patients . when the incidence of sln metastases was stratified by t stage ( t1/t2 and t3/t4 ) , the rate of positive slns was dramatically less common in elderly patients with t3 or t4 melanoma versus their younger counterparts ( 18% vs. 33% , p=0.02 ) . the median follow up time was 3.8 years ( range 0 - 12.6 years ) . the elderly patients had a higher rate of recurrence ( including local / in - transit , regional , or systemic recurrence ) relative to the younger patients ( 25.2% vs 9.1% 5 years after surgery ; hazard ratio [ hr]=2.6 , p<0.001 ; figure 1a ) . additionally , the elderly patients had a higher rate of local / in - transit recurrence ( 14.5% vs 3.4% 5 years after surgery ; hr=3.6 , p<0.001 ; figure 1b ) and systemic recurrence ( 14.9% vs 6% 5 years after surgery ; hr=1.83 , p=0.05 ; figure 1c ) . subset analysis of age groups < 50 , 50 - 59 , 60 - 69 and > 70 showed progressively worse outcomes with age , as expected . recurrence - free survival rates in the subset analysis were 91.8% , 85.6% , 82% , and 60% respectively for age groups in ascending order . relative to age group < 50 , hazard ratios for the age groups 50 - 59 , 60 - 69 , and > 70 were 1.98 ( p=0.08 ) , 2.15 ( p=0.03 ) , and 5.42 ( p<0.001 ) respectively . 5-year mortality rate from all causes was greater in the elderly group , 29.8% vs. 12.3% 5 years after surgery ( hr=3.0 , p<0.001 ; figure 2a ) . additionally , 5-year disease - specific mortality was higher for those 70 years old : 16.1% vs. 8.2% ( hr=2.3 , p=0.004 ; figure 2b ) . in a multivariate model of melanoma - specific survival , age remained significant after adjusting for known prognostic factors of tumor thickness and positive sln status . in our cohort of patients undergoing sln biopsy , melanoma in the elderly was more common on the head and neck , less likely to arise from a pre - existing nevus , had greater mean tumor thickness and more mitotic figures than melanoma in their younger counterparts . additionally , higher t - stage melanoma in the elderly was less likely to result in positive sentinel node biopsy . they were more likely to have recurrence , including a higher rate of local / in - transit recurrence and systemic recurrence . studied 399 patients with melanoma who underwent sln biopsy and compared patients 50 years vs. > 50 years . they found the melanoma patients > 50 to have thicker lesions and a higher incidence of ulceration but no difference in the incidence of lymph node metastases . overall survival was worse among the group > 50 and age was a significant prognostic variable in multivariate analysis13 . data from the seer database and medicare enrollment and claims files , showed that increasing age after 65 years and melanoma detection by a dermatologist were significantly predictive of survival on multivariate analysis in a population of over 2000 patients 14 . in a large dataset of 17,600 melanoma patients , age was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival which was consistent within each thickness subgroup9 . worse prognosis in the elderly may be attributable to the fact that the elderly , especially elderly men , melanoma has been shown to have a more rapid growth rate15 , thicker tumors16 and histologic ulceration16 . age as a poor prognostic factor may be the result of weakened immune defense mechanisms 17 , 18 , which may play a role in melanoma progression . lastly , competing co - morbidities are much more prevalent in older patients , further contributing to higher overall mortality . elderly melanoma patients have been shown to present with tumors of advanced breslow level 3 , 9 , 19 , 20 . late diagnosis has been implicated as a cause for thicker melanoma with poor prognosis in the elderly . some reasons may include scarcely visible anatomical locations of new pigmented lesions ( i.e. scalp , back ) , loss of a partner 's input on home examination , poor vision , less importance placed on changing lesions , and confusing new or changing benign seborrheic keratoses for pigmented lesions21 , 22 . studies have shown disproportionately low screening of elderly men despite this population accounting for 44% of melanoma cases discovered23 . higher incidence of head and neck melanoma is likely attributable to cumulative photodamage and higher incidence of lentigo maligna melanoma as patients age . showed that lentigo maligna melanoma was the only melanoma subtype with increasing incidence over a ten - year period and was more common in men 65 years 24 . as the percentage of elderly persons in the world 's population continues to grow , physicians performing melanoma screening should devote heightened attention to heavily sun - exposed sites where melanoma is more and more commonly discovered . our data confirmed previously reported findings that the elderly are less likely to have melanoma associated with a pre - existing nevus25 . malignant progression may be the result of continuous and cumulative photodamage to melanocytes not within a nevus26 . this has clinical implications to patient education and early detection of melanoma in that age group . when counseling elderly patients regarding self - screening , a shift of focus from characteristics of changing nevi ( abcde of melanoma ) to awareness of any new growths may lead to more routine screening and earlier detection . our data demonstrated that the mitotic rate in the elderly melanoma patients was higher than their younger counterparts . mitotic rate has been associated with worse clinical outcomes in melanoma patients and has been identified as an independent prognostic factor in multiple studies 27 - 29 . in a multifactorial analysis of 10,233 patients with clinically localized melanoma , mitotic rate was the second best prognostic factor of survival behind tumor thickness 29 . in a series of more than 1200 cases , higher mitotic rate tumor burden has also been implicated as a factor contributing to a greater likelihood of local / in -

regional recurrences , and worse clinical outcomes . additionally , they had a lower positive sln rate , indicating that mitotic activity had less impact on sln result in the elderly compared to younger patients . in advanced t - stage melanoma , despite worse disease - specific and overall mortality , the elderly had far fewer cases of positive sln biopsies . studied 5 age groups of melanoma patients in a large series of over 3000 patients . they showed a progressive decline in incidence of sln metastasis with increasing age across all five age groups . the oldest group ( > 60 years ) had a positive sln rate of 14.4% , significantly less than the next nearest age groups 3 . our cohort of elderly patients ( 70 years ) demonstrated a comparable rate of positive sln in 11% . the reason for fewer cases of positive sentinel lymph node biopsies remains uncertain but may be accounted by altered lymphatic drainage in the elderly12 . although the mode of spread in any cancer is never certain , it appears that like younger patients , melanoma in the elderly principally spreads along lymphatic routes as there are more in - transit metastases noted in this age group 32 . uv irradiation has been shown to induce vegf - a - mediated damage of cutaneous lymphatic channels 33 , 34 . lifelong accumulation of photodamage is likely contributory to disruption of lymphatic channels , as well as gravity - dependent degeneration , disallowing complete migration of tumor cells to the sentinel node in areas of atrophied lymphatic channels in the elderly . time to recurrence has been shown to be an independent predictor of post - recurrence survival35 . additionally , advanced age at the time of recurrence diagnosis has been associated with poor prognosis 36 - 38 . studied 279 melanoma patients with recurrence and found that those patients who had recurrence in 12 months or less from treatment of primary melanoma had significantly worse post - recurrence survival and progression - free survival rates35 . a recent long - term follow - up study of 2487 patients showed that advanced age , male sex , high pn , and distant metastases as the first site of recurrence were associated with worse survival outcomes after the manifestation of recurrent disease38 . subset analysis of age groups < 50 , 50 - 59 , 60 - 69 , > 70 was of limited statistical power because of small number of events in each group . data was retrieved only from patients undergoing sentinel lymph node biopsy ; given the potential selection bias , it may not be valid to generalize conclusions to the entire elderly population with melanoma . lastly , the follow - up period is limited to a mean of 3.8 years , which may influence outcome data to reflect more poorly on the elderly population . given the differing clinical presentation , primary melanoma characteristics , and disparate disease - specific outcomes of melanoma in the elderly compared to non - elderly patients , clinicians and surgeons should be mindful of proper screening and risk - stratification of elderly patients when participating in their care . due to the higher risk of in - transit disease , follow - up should focus on loco - regional recurrences . many adjuvant clinical trials are geared to patients with lymph node positive disease . due to the fact that the elderly have a much lower incidence of lymph node positive disease but otherwise poorer prognosis , age may need to be included when developing clinical trials in order to evaluate the efficacy of adjuvant therapy in this patient population .",

And I've spoken with somebody close to the Gores who did receive this e-mail, who says that they've asked for their privacy. That clearly this has been something they have been talking about for quite some time. And it's kind of, you know, for those of us who have watched political couples over the years, it's kind of sad because the Gores were this fabulous couple to watch when he was running for president.

Yes.</s>BORGER: And we talked about it for years and years after that as sort of the one -- there it is -</s>HARRIS: There it is.</s>BORGER: The one emotional moment we recall from Al Gore. A couple that's always been quite supportive of each other and of their families. So it's one of those things that people are scratching their heads about, but it's very clear that the Gores have given this a great deal of thought.</s>HARRIS: Yes. I'm just getting world that this is a couple that's been together for, as a married couple for 40 years.</s>BORGER: Forty years, right.</s>HARRIS: Forty years.</s>BORGER: Forty years.</s>HARRIS: And they were definitely a power couple and certainly an issues as couple.</s>BORGER: And -</s>HARRIS: What were you going to say, Gloria?</s>BORGER: Well, I was also going to say, you know, it's interesting, if you think back to the whole Monica Lewinsky saga, internally at the White House, the Gores were kind of the strong couple and the Clintons were the couple having all the problems.</s>HARRIS: Yes.</s>BORGER: And I think that that created a lot of friction between the president and the vice president. And so it's very surprising to people that -- and sad, as I said, to their friends that this is happening right now.</s>HARRIS: You know, I remember Tipper Gore talking about the two of them being an issues couple.

They used to have -- open the vice president's house for Halloween parties, which were pretty famous in Washington because they used to get dressed up in these kind of lavish costumes. So family was always a very big thing to them, which is why I think their friends are trying to give them a little bit of distance here and a little bit of quiet to deal with this.</s>HARRIS: Right.

pnet of kidney is known to respond poorly to chemotherapy and a functional imaging modality may serve as a useful tool to demonstrate early response in such rare cases .  marrow flip flop  could be due to involved marrow being replaced by fibrosis as a treatment response and hence would not demonstrate the marrow stimulation effect of colony - stimulating factors on a pet scan done to assess therapeutic response . in conclusion , though uncommon , the reporting physician should be aware of findings of  pet super scan  as demonstrated in this patient . reversal of these abnormalities on functional imaging following therapy guides the clinician to choose the best available regimen for this otherwise chemotherapy nave disease .",

I'm Debbie Elliott.</s>DEBBIE ELLIOTT, host: Rescuers are digging through the rubble in a frantic search for survivors      of yesterday's earthquake in Pakistan and India.  At least 20,000 are      reported dead and more than 40,000 injured, and those numbers are      expected to rise. Today, Pakistani President General Pervaiz Musharraf      called it the worst disaster in the country's history and appealed to the      world for help.</s>President PERVAIZ MUSHARRAF (Pakistan): I hope that you realize this      hour of crisis to our nation.</s>DEBBIE ELLIOTT, host: The quake was centered in the Hindu Kush Mountains, but      affected an area spanning more than 700 square miles.  The most severe      damage is in Kashmir, the region at the center of a political struggle      between India and Pakistan.  Entire villages have been destroyed.  Vivian      Tan is with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in      Islamabad.</s>Ms. VIVIAN TAN (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees): There's      an urgent need for a coordinated response.  Road conditions are very,      very bad. Landslides and mudslides have cut off access to large parts of      the north of the country, and broken infrastructure also makes it hard      for trucks or cars to deliver aid to people who need them urgently.</s>DEBBIE ELLIOTT, host: Tan says 24 international rescue teams are either in the region      or on the way.</s>DEBBIE ELLIOTT, host: Reporter Ron Moreau is based in Islamabad with Newsweek magazine.  He      says in that city, rescuers are trying to reach people inside a collapsed      12-story apartment building.</s>Mr. RON MOREAU (Newsweek): There are probably, they estimate, about a      hundred people that are still trapped in the rubble, and it's killed      certainly more than a dozen people and injured certainly more than a      hundred.</s>DEBBIE ELLIOTT, host: I've seen pictures of this building and it looks like there are      buildings standing on either side, but the one in the middle is just      completely collapsed.  Are rescuers able to reach the victims?</s>Mr. RON MOREAU (Newsweek): Yes, they have.  I mean, there's even a team from the UK      that's come.  Then there are, you know, construction cranes trying to      lift the concrete slab.  But it's a very delicate situation because      they're afraid by too much lifting of the slabs they could, you know,      collapse that pancaked structure even more and perhaps even kill the      people who are still trapped in the holes inside this rubble.</s>DEBBIE ELLIOTT, host: Have you been able to get out of Islamabad and see what's      happening in other parts of the affected area?</s>Mr. RON MOREAU (Newsweek): Well, I haven't been able to get to the area that was      pretty much the epicenter of the earthquake, Muzaffarabad, which is the      capital of Pakistani-administered Kashmir.  But I talked to Pakistani      officials.  Up to 70 percent of the town of Muzaffarabad, which is a town      of--I don't know--about 40,000 people, has collapsed.  And it's pretty      isolated; it's only accessible by helicopter.  Most of the roads have      been closed by landslides, or the road has just fallen into the Neelum      River.  And a lot of schoolchildren were killed, also, because children      were in school at 9:00 in the morning on Saturday when the earthquake      occurred, so hundreds of children, it is believed, died in the--as the      schools collapsed right on top of them.</s>DEBBIE ELLIOTT, host: How are officials dealing with just getting people help?</s>Mr. RON MOREAU (Newsweek): Well, the only help coming right now to the most badly      affected areas is by helicopter.  And the Pakistanis have taken--using      all of their helicopter assets.  In fact, they've even had to take      helicopters out of the Afghanistan border region--where they're still      fighting local tribal militants who are allied with the Taliban and      al-Qaeda--and they brought those helicopters into play to bring relief      supplies into the area and evacuate the wounded out.</s>Mr. RON MOREAU (Newsweek): And now the Americans are bringing in Chinook helicopters--they'll start      arriving tomorrow--to beef up the amount of helicopters that the      Pakistanis have.  And, of course, the United States has dozens of Chinook      twin-rotor helicopters in Afghanistan, so when those helicopters get in,      they'll be able to get, you know, more relief in to the people of the      area.  But there's a great need, the prime minister says, for medicine,      blankets and tents especially, because it's--in this mountainous area,      it's getting cold already, and a lot of people are being forced to live      outside.</s>DEBBIE ELLIOTT, host: India, which has also been affected by the earthquake, was the      first to pledge to help Pakistan.  Can you tell us what the response has      been to that offer?</s>Mr. RON MOREAU (Newsweek): Well, the Pakistani response is basically, `Thank you very      much, but we can take care of our own problems,' and I think that's the      way it will continue.  I think they'll try and work more closely with      their--with other allies, whether in the Muslim world or in the West.      And also, the Indians kind of have their own hands full in their own area      in Kashmir, in the--just across the border.</s>DEBBIE ELLIOTT, host: What about the aftershocks?  Are there still aftershocks?</s>Mr. RON MOREAU (Newsweek): Oh, yes, indeed.  I mean, it's very frightening.  I mean,      it's frightening enough for people here in Islamabad.  There have been      certainly more than a dozen, maybe 15 or so aftershocks, and there were      even some last night and a couple today.  It's bad enough here in the      city, but you can imagine the people out in the rural areas.  The      aftershocks just make them think that the whole thing is going to--their      nightmare is going to recur again.  And when the aftershocks occur, as      the prime minister said today, in that mountainous area, it kicks up      great dust clouds which, you know, hamper rescue efforts, also.</s>DEBBIE ELLIOTT, host: Where are they taking the wounded when they're able to reach      people who've been hurt?</s>Mr. RON MOREAU (Newsweek): Well, that's the problem, because most of the hospitals in      the most affected area have been partially or completely destroyed.  So      they're trying to set up some kind of makeshift medical facilities on the      spot.  But the helicopters that are going into these areas to bring in      relief supplies are bringing the wounded out to the cities, whether it's      up to Peshawar in the northwest or down to Islamabad.  And the hospital      facilities that are on the spot, though, are totally overwhelmed.</s>DEBBIE ELLIOTT, host: Ron Moreau is a reporter for Newsweek magazine.  He's speaking      with us from Islamabad.</s>DEBBIE ELLIOTT, host: Thank you very much.</s>Mr. RON MOREAU (Newsweek): Thank you.",

    "document": "the \n field of small - molecule organocatalysis via noncovalent interactions \n has seen rampant growth over the past decade . this area , which aims to mimic the mechanisms used by nature in \n enzyme catalysis , is attractive due to its potential for high catalyst \n tunability and substrate specificity , as well as obviating the use \n of metals . while such research has resulted in many catalysts operating \n through bifunctional mechanisms , the primary \n interaction responsible for electrophile activation occurs through \n hydrogen - bonding to an acceptor moiety . the consequent lumo - lowering \n results in rate enhancement . in comparison to metal - based systems \n ( i.e. , lewis acids ) , current metrics to estimate the reactivity of hydrogen \n bonding catalysts are ineffective . although pka values of the donor and acceptor may be used to infer \n hydrogen - bond strengths , this analysis \n fails to account for several important secondary interactions , including \n sterics , dual - activation , and binding geometry . as a result , the discovery of reactions compatible with \n hydrogen - bond catalysis is far outpacing understanding of catalyst \n interaction and mechanism . indeed , while certain privileged organocatalyst \n motifs have been identified to be successful for several reaction \n types , rational design of these structures remains limited , relying \n on trial and error to achieve optimal reactivity and selectivity . in a previous communication , we described \n preliminary results showing the utility of small organic chromophore s for the detection of hydrogen - bonding interactions by uv  herein , we assess the general utility of this colorimetric \n sensor as a predictive gauge for the relative reactivity of a broad \n range of organocatalysts , including several widely used motifs , with \n the goal of encompassing many different hydrogen - bonding arrays . an \n additional goal was to validate the sensor measurements across significantly \n different reaction profiles , particularly those involving noncarbonyl \n electrophiles . the lack of comprehensive rate data for a range of \n catalysts in different reactions is a barrier to understanding the \n factors controlling catalytic activation . as a consequence , the relative \n rates have been measured for an array of catalysts in two reactions \n with different groups that interact with the catalysts . the sensor \n signal has been analyzed with respect to reaction profile , catalyst \n structure , acidity , and acceptor preference . our findings establish \n the sensor as a useful substrate  surrogate  for probing \n and gauging catalyst performance . moreover , the data unequivocally \n establish that catalyst structure and binding mode are far more relevant \n to catalytic activity than acidity . a key consideration in designing a method \n for measuring hydrogen - bond strengths is the very broad range of these \n noncovalent interactions ( 0.240 kcal / mol ) . observing the very weak range of these interactions is \n a challenge with commonly employed spectroscopic techniques . for example , \n despite successful application in measuring lewis acid binding effects , preliminary nmr studies proved too insensitive \n for detecting the interactions of weak hydrogen - bonding catalysts \n with a carbonyl acceptor . we proposed \n an alternative approach using the sensitivity of uv  vis absorption \n profiles , in which a change in electronic excitation of an acceptor \n chromophore occurs upon binding to a hydrogen - bond donor ( scheme 1 ) . specifically , imidazopyrazinone s displays solvatochromism with protic solvents as well as color changes \n with a small number of lewis acids . we \n postulated that upon treatment with various hydrogen - bond donors , \n the carbonyl moiety of s would act as an acceptor moiety . \n the resulting hydrogen - bonding interaction would alter the electronic \n transition of the chromophore , detectable by simple uv  vis \n spectroscopy . in line with this reasoning , treatment of sensor s in dichloromethane with various hydrogen - bond donors resulted \n in \n visible hypsochromic ( blue ) shifts ( figure 1 ) . importantly , compounds anticipated to be weaker donors , such as \n diphenylthiourea ( 1 ) , yielded significant changes in \n sensor signal . variation of binder concentration resulted in titration - like \n behavior , with a measurable end point upon saturation of sensor with \n catalyst . an array of catalysts ( chart 1 ) , \n varying in structure and anticipated strength , was examined with the \n colorimetric sensor , and the max upon saturation \n was determined . response in the uv  vis spectrum of s upon increasing \n amounts of 12 . [ s ] = 2.22  10 m in ch2cl2 ,   = 0 to 1.78  10 m. dft molecular orbital calculations were performed \n on bound and \n unbound sensor for selected hydrogen - bonding agents to gauge the orbital \n perturbation ( table 1 ) . the calculated lowest \n energy transition accurately predicts the observed absorbance maximum \n for the free sensor . lumo energy \n gap was larger for all bound complexes , in accord with the empirically \n observed hypsochromic shift in figure 1 . an \n increased shift ( lower max ) is predicted for binders \n of ostensibly greater strength ( e.g. , proton > benzoic acid > \n phenol ) . the \n uv absorption behavior of the sensor with the hydrogen - bonding \n agent can be represented as shown in figure 2a . the lowest energy electronic transition may be ascribed to the \n n ( homo ) to  * ( lumo ) transition , e1 , corresponding to the measured max . as \n supported by the above calculations , addition of a hydrogen - bonding \n agent stabilizes the ground state ( homo ) to a greater extent than \n the excited state ( lumo ) , i.e. , e3 > e2 . as a consequence , a \n hypsochromic \n shift is observed upon interaction of the sensor with the hydrogen - bond \n donors . for comparison , figure 2b illustrates \n the energy diagram for a typical reaction with a hydrogen - bonding \n catalyst , in which catalysis is effected by lumo - lowering of the electrophile \n ( ea ) . e2 is proportional to ea , i.e. , \n the wavelength shift of the bound sensorcatalyst is proportional \n to the rate enhancement afforded in a reaction with the hydrogen - bonding \n catalyst . ( a ) proposed energy diagram of the lowest energy electronic transition \n of the sensor upon interaction with catalysts of increasing strength , \n corresponding to the hypsochromic wavelength shift ( max ) . ( b ) lumo - lowering of reactants via hydrogen - bonding catalysts , \n corresponding to increased reaction rates ( krel ) . as shown in figure 1 , a continuous \n wavelength shift was revealed upon saturation of the sensor with the \n catalyst . the lack of two distinct peaks in intermediate measurements \n containing both bound and unbound sensor indicates a rapid equilibration . \n thus , plots of absorbance vs [ catalyst ] ( see figure 3 for an example with bisamidinium 12 ) were used \n to determine the binding constants ( keq ) for the sensorcatalyst \n complex . a significant range of blue shifts was observed for the different \n catalyst donors , ranging from 490 to 465 nm ( max 1030 nm ) . in general , catalysts with larger \n  max values possessed much stronger binding \n constants . since e1 is proportional \n to 1/max , the energetics of the interaction of the \n sensor with the catalysts ( e3  \n e2 ) is proportional to 1/max(sensorcatalyst )  1/max(sensor ) . indeed , a good correlation of this inverse wavelength shift \n with ln(keq ) was found ( figure 4 ) . note that in this plot , both axes are linearly proportional to \n energy terms :  to the e of the sensor electronic absorption , and ln(keq ) to g of sensorcatalyst \n formation . importantly , this relationship establishes the observed \n wavelength shift as a reliable gauge for binding affinity of a catalyst \n to the sensor molecule . uv - titration curve of catalyst 12 in ch2cl2 using [ s ] = 2.22  \n 10 m. inlay : visible color change of sensor before \n ( red ) and after \n addition of 12 ( yellow ;   = 1.78  \n 10 m ) . all titrations were performed with [ s ] = 2.22  10 m in ch2cl2 . using the sensorcatalyst wavelength shift as predictors \n of catalyst reactivity yields several noteworthy observations . diol - based 30 ( taddol ) and silanol catalysts 31 and 32 afforded very weak shifts , despite application in numerous \n transformations , including rawal s seminal report on the asymmetric \n hetero diels  alder reaction . the \n greater max shift of 32 compared to \n the related monosilanol 31 mirrors the increased reactivity \n of this silanediol scaffold , as elegantly reported by mattson and franz . benzoic acids \n and phenols spanned the intermediate range of sensor shifts , with \n trends clearly based on the electronic effects of aromatic substitution . \n although these structures are not as commonly incorporated as hydrogen - bond \n catalysts , schafmeister and co - workers have recently demonstrated \n the spiroligozyme catalyst 24 , containing a carefully \n arranged carboxylic acid and phenol , as an effective ketosteroid isomerase \n mimic for the aromatic claisen rearrangement.n , n-diaryl thioureas and \n ureas , particularly those with multiple trifluoromethyl substituents \n such as schreiner s catalyst 4 , afforded some of the largest sensor shifts , indicative \n of the immense utility of these structures in various organocatalysts . the internally activated bf2-urea 9 provided the largest shift within this class , in line with \n experimental reactivity data reported by mattson and co - workers . finally , formally cationic species , including \n guanidinium , amidinium , and takenaka s azaindolium 14(22 ) were the strongest binders , with wavelength \n shifts ranging from 26 to 34 nm ( max = 473465 \n nm ) . interestingly , one of the strongest noncationic binders was thiophosphoramide 16 , possessing a pocket of three potential n  h donors . \n squaramide - containing scaffolds have yielded excellent results as \n hydrogen - bond activators ; however , these compounds \n possess limited solubility , and are typically employed as heterogeneous \n catalysts . representative squaramide 11 , containing the \n common n-3,5-(cf3)2aryl and n-alkyl array , was synthesized , and gave an apparent \n sensor end point of 480 nm . due to its relative insolubility , \n an accurate binding equilibrium value could not be determined . it is worth noting the experimental ease with which the sensor \n metric can be obtained . compound s itself is easily obtained \n in 2 steps from commercial materials , and very little \n sensor or catalyst ( particularly for strong catalysts ) is necessary \n to obtain the wavelength shift . the titration experiment is largely \n insensitive to moisture , as illustrated by the poor binding observed \n in the sensor titration with water . applying the method of continuous \n variation to the sensor with \n catalyst 12 revealed a 1:1 binding stoichiometry with \n the sensor molecule ( figure 5 ) . this observation is significant , since several \n other binding situations may be postulated , including donation of \n one catalyst molecule to several sensors ( 4 equivalent n  job plot analysis of \n catalyst 12 with sensor s showing 1:1 binding \n stoichiometry . benzoic acids and phenols \n offer useful templates to study electronic \n effects on sensor signal due to availability and well - understood behavior \n of aromatic substitution . due to solubility limitations , ortho - substituted benzoic acids were studied rather than the para - substituted analogs . the electronic effects from substitution on \n the sensor interaction can be illustrated via a hammett - type plot , \n as shown in figure 6 . as may be anticipated \n from the brnsted catalysis law ( see section 2.6 for further discussion ) , increasingly electron - withdrawing \n substituents on these structures correlate with larger hypsochromic \n shifts of the sensorcatalyst complex . for both catalyst sets , \n highly linear relationships are evident with substituent  parameters \n indicating that the wavelength shift provides an accurate readout \n of electronic perturbation on the hydrogen - bonding ability . correlation \n of hammett  parameters for o - benzoic acids \n ( ortho ) and p - phenols ( para ) \n with sensorcatalyst wavelength shifts . notably , the wavelength shifts seen with the sensor do not \n correspond \n directly with pka either in water ( figure 7a , r = 0.0007 ) or dmso \n ( figure 7b , r = \n 0.0950 ) . however , correlations are observed for closely related catalyst \n structures , wherein electronic perturbations modify the acidity of \n the donor moiety without introducing significant secondary effects . \n this observation provides potential for the sensor to estimate pka values within a series of related compounds . \n persubstituted phenol 29 deviates from other phenolic \n catalysts , which may be attributed to the increased steric demand \n around the donating o  plot of catalyst acidity in water ( a ) \n or dmso ( b ) vs sensorcatalyst \n wavelength shifts . the correlation of the \n observed blue shift with the binding strength \n across a large range of hydrogen - bond donors proved the metric to \n be able to quantitatively detect these interactions . however , this \n finding does not necessitate a correlation with catalyst \n reactivity . in order for this correlation to occur , the sensor must \n be a good facsimile of the substrate that is undergoing reaction . \n other factors , including alternate binding modes and steric effects , \n might come into play when a substrate interacts with hydrogen - bonding \n agent in a catalyzed reaction . to be a useful metric \n for the community , the sensor signal must correlate to empirically \n obtained rate enhancement via hydrogen - bond catalysis ( scheme 2 ) . myriad reaction profiles have been reported that \n are established to proceed via hydrogen - bond activation of the electrophile \n ( lumo - lowering activation ) . in order to best isolate the reactivity \n enhancement offered by the catalysts strictly due to hydrogen - bonding , \n we first targeted a reaction where the electrophile has only one possible \n point of interaction with the catalyst , and the nucleophile does not \n contain binding points ( i.e. , no heteroatoms ) . additionally , the reaction \n should have minimal background rate and a method to easily analyze \n starting material and/or product concentrations . the reaction of methyl vinyl ketone ( mvk ) with cyclopentadiene \n ( cp ) offers a useful reaction platform that fulfills these criteria \n ( scheme 3 ) , and has been used to gauge the \n relative strength of thiourea and bisphenol catalysts previously . importantly , \n the binding in the sensorcatalyst complex is very similar \n to that of the mvkcatalyst intermediate as both interactions \n arise from a carbonyl acting as a hydrogen - bond acceptor . systematic investigation of the diels  alder reaction \n of \n mvk and cp with a variety of catalysts was performed under pseudo - first \n order conditions as described in scheme 3 . \n kinetic data was acquired via continuous sampling ( 5 min intervals ) \n by h nmr spectroscopy , and each rate measurement was performed \n in triplicate . relative rate constants , krel , were calculated as described in eq 1 from \n the observed pseudo - first order rate constant kobs and background rate kbackground , and were normalized for catalyst concentration n. the resulting \n values directly provide the rate enhancement afforded by the catalyst.1 as displayed in figure 8 , a plot of ln(krel ) against the \n inverse sensor wavelength shift \n of 18 catalysts shows an excellent correlation . catalysts with greater \n blue shifts when treated with the sensor show greater activity in \n the diels  alder reaction via correspondingly greater lumo lowering \n of the ketone in the dienophile . more precisely , the change in energy \n of the sensor upon binding with the catalyst is proportional to the \n change in activation energy of the hydrogen - bond catalyzed diels  alder \n reaction . correlation between the sensorcatalyst wavelength shift \n and catalyst rate enhancement in the diels  alder reaction between \n mvk and cp . the observed correlation \n establishes that , at least in this class \n of reaction , the sensor signal is a good indicator of lumo - lowering \n ability of these small molecules as hydrogen - bond catalysts . importantly , \n the results also indicate that the binding interaction of the sensor \n with catalysts is similar to that of methyl vinyl ketone with catalyst , \n i.e. the sensor is a useful gauge of carbonyl activation . the addition of \n various nucleophiles into nitroalkenes is one of the most widely used \n reaction motifs in hydrogen - bonding catalysts ; it is often used as \n a measure of reactivity when developing and comparing novel catalyst \n structures . to test the effectiveness of our sensor \n metric beyond the diels  alder reaction crafts \n addition of n - methylindole ( 34 ) into \n nitrostyrene 35 ( scheme 4 ) . deuterated 35 was easily prepared via henry condensation using d3-nitromethane with the corresponding aldehyde . \n nucleophile 34 provides a reasonably active coupling \n partner while minimizing potential catalyst interactions [ pka(h2o ) n - methylindolium \n = 1.8 ] . thus , the effects of \n hydrogen bonding catalysts on the activation of the styrene electrophile \n via binding to the nitro acceptor can be cleanly delineated . significantly , the catalyzed rates of this reaction allow \n comparison \n of the effects of hydrogen - bonding catalysts on carbonyl acceptors \n ( the sensor and mvk ) versus nitro acceptors ( nitrostyrene 35 ) as outlined in scheme 5 . while binding geometries \n to carbonyl groups are anticipated to be similar , an analogous correlation \n may not be automatically presumed for a nitro group . in particular , \n the nitro group contains a formally delocalized negative charge across \n three atoms , and has been suggested to form -activated \n intermediates with certain catalyst structural types such as squaramides \n and thioureas . as illustrated in figure 9 , kinetic reaction \n data was acquired using h nmr spectroscopy . although initial h nmr spectroscopic studies with proteo-35 provided \n usable data , employment of a deuterium label provides exceptional \n signal isolation . moreover , overlap of signals from the catalyst is \n completely mitigated , since only substrate , product , and internal \n standard exhibit appreciable resonances . as a result , any \n catalyst can be readily analyzed . ( a ) stacked h nmr plot and ( b ) kinetic profile for \n the friedel  crafts reaction shown in scheme 4 using catalyst 12 . conditions :   = 1.33 m ,   = 0.133 m ,   = 0.133 \n m ,   = 2.67  10 m. the cdcl3 peak arises from natural abundance in chcl3 . crafts reaction \n was studied under pseudo - first \n order conditions using the broad series of hydrogen - bond catalysts \n shown in chart 1 . the relative catalytic strength \n of each catalyst was calculated according to eq 1 , using averaged kobs values \n from duplicate trials . a plot of ln(krel ) and inverse sensor wavelength shift is shown in figure 10a . similar to the diels  alder reaction , \n and predicted based on sensor shifts , cationic binders proved to be \n the most effective catalysts , followed by electron - deficient ureas \n and thioureas . squaramide 11 , employed here as a heterogeneous \n catalyst , provided moderate rate enhancement as predicted by its sensor \n wavelength shift . the krel values \n reported for these catalysts and 4 align closely with \n the values measured in this work . ( a ) correlation observed between the \n sensorcatalyst wavelength \n shift and catalyst rate enhancement in the friedel  crafts reaction . \n the overall correlation of the sensor wavelength \n shift with catalyst \n strength for the friedel  crafts reaction is good ( r2 = 0.84 ) , but not as strong as that found in the diels  alder \n reaction ( r2 = 0.95 ) . analysis of this \n data suggests that the binding interaction of a hydrogen - bonding catalyst \n with the sensor carbonyl does not fully mimic that of a hydrogen - bonding \n catalyst with the activated nitroalkene . closer inspection reveals \n that the wavelength shift is correlated even more strongly to catalyst \n strength within an isostructural catalyst series ( figure 10b ) . specifically , the catalysts can be placed in \n four groups based on their general structure : benzoic acids , phenols , \n  y - type  binders , and other n  h binders . the \n y - type group consists of catalysts possessing two n  h donor \n groups separated by a single atom , such as ureas , thioureas , guanidines , \n bis - sulfonamides , etc . the other n  h binders include those \n catalysts that have more than one atom separating the donor array \n ( squaramide 11 , bisamidinium 12 ) or can \n only donate one n  interestingly , the silanediol catalyst 32 exhibits reactivity falling nicely in line with benzoic acids , possibly \n due to a similar o  h geometry . this analysis quantitatively \n shows that y - type structures are superior for nitroalkene activation . \n in contrast , phenols provided the least activation relative to their \n binding interaction with the sensor . overall , the sensor provides \n a good assessment of relative reactivity \n of hydrogen - bond catalysts in the friedel  crafts reaction . \n the presence of stronger correlations within catalyst structural classes \n is consistent with some catalysts activating nitroalkenes via a different \n mode ( e.g. , -binding ) that is not completely captured \n by the interactions of the catalysts with the carbonyl of the sensor \n molecule . this analysis underlines the complex nature of hydrogen - bonding , \n emphasizing that caution must be exercised in generalizing catalyst \n reactivity or selectivity from one reaction to another . a general equation to describe catalyst strength \n for reaction r based on sensor response (  ) is presented in eq 2 . parameter rr ( slope ) represents the responsiveness of the rate per unit catalyst strength as determined by the sensor \n measurement . parameter cr ( y - intercept ) corresponds to inherent complementarity of the catalyst to the electrophilic reaction partner.2 the parameter \n values ( table 2 ) for the reactions shown in \n scheme 3 ( diels  alder ) and scheme 4 ( friedel  crafts ) \n were obtained using the kinetic data from figures 8 and 10 , respectively . comparison of \n the rda and rfc values reveals that the friedel  crafts is more sensitive \n to catalyst strength . in other words , the same catalyst produces a \n greater relative rate enhancement for the friedel  crafts reaction \n than for the diels  alder reaction . similarly , a given wavelength \n shift of the sensor by a catalyst will cause a greater reactivity \n change in the friedel  crafts vs the diels  alder reaction . \n on the other hand , the cda and cfc values indicate the inherent complementarity of the electrophilic substrate with catalysts ; greater complementarity translates to greater reactivity . notably , the c values represent reactivity when there is no wavelength shift ( no \n perturbation of the sensor by the catalysts ) and represent the lower \n limit of lumo activation afforded by the catalyst . catalyst group - specific coefficients rr and cr can be \n introduced ( eq 3 ) to account for variation if \n the sensor binds the \n catalyst differently than the reaction electrophile . due to the strong \n correlation of the sensor shift to relative rates independent of catalyst \n structure , coefficients are unnecessary for the diels  alder \n reaction ( rda  cda  1 ) . as discussed in section 2.4 , the sensor does not completely model catalyst binding to \n the nitrostyrene acceptor of the friedel  crafts reaction . accordingly , \n the slope and intercept data from figure 10b were combined with the r and c values from table 2 to afford coefficient \n values for rfc and cfc , respectively , as provided in table 3.3 the coefficient values in table 3 reveal \n general trends between the different catalyst structural types and \n rate in the friedel  again , rfc values are a measure of responsiveness of a given catalyst architecture to a perturbation in sensor binding . \n for y - type and phenolic catalysts , rfc is noticeably higher than the other n  h binders , and particularly \n benzoic acids . thus , for the same amount of wavelength shift , the \n phenol and y - type catalysts provide greater increases in reactivity \n relative to the other n  h binders and benzoic acids . this observation \n indicates that the sensor can assess electronic effects in a catalyst \n series . comparison of the hammett effects on  ( figure 6 ; acid = 5.8 , \n phenol = 4.4 ) with those on ln(krel ) ( acid = 0.60 , phenol = 0.33 ) provides support for this assertion ; \n both measures show a stronger electronic effect for the carboxylic \n acid series . on the other hand , lower cfc values \n indicate the inherent complementarity of a given \n catalyst architecture . for example , the y - type binders activate nitro \n electrophiles to a greater extent at a given wavelength shift relative \n to phenols or the other n  h binders . interestingly , the cfc value for benzoic acids would predict high \n catalytic activity relative to y - type binders , but only in the weak \n binding regime ( left side of plot ) . due to the low rfc value for benzoic acids , the trends invert such that \n y - type binders are superior in the strong binding regime ( right side \n of plot ) . considering both terms together , the y - type binders are \n both more complementary to the nitroalkene and more efficient at lumo \n lowering , thereby providing superior reactivity . acidity values have widely been used \n as a guiding principle in hydrogen - bond catalyst design , under the \n premise that a more acidic donor will form a stronger interaction \n and stabilize the buildup of anionic charge in the transition state \n to a greater extent . indeed , several reports have observed increased \n activity with judicious electronic tuning of the donor hydrogen . however , even ostensibly subtle changes to catalyst structure can \n cause secondary factors to override the reliability of pka as a predictive measure , as demonstrated by cheng s \n recent study on thiourea derivatives \n and even noted in the seminal work by hine on mono- and bis - phenols . having proved the effectiveness of the sensor \n signal as a gauge for catalyst strength , we undertook a comparison \n with acidity to determine the similarities and differences between \n the two metrics . aggregate data for all catalysts spanning 3 \n orders of magnitude in reactivity for the diels  alder reaction \n and 4 orders in the friedel  crafts reaction is organized by \n increasing sensor wavelength shift in table 4 . recent efforts by schreiner and others provided accurate acidity values of common hydrogen - bond \n donors . the brnsted catalysis equation ( eq 4 ) , which describes the relationship for the rate of an acid - catalyzed \n reaction with the pka of the acid , was applied to this data.4 value for 2-naphthol . figures 11 and 12 display the results for selected \n catalyst series in the diels  alder \n and friedel  crafts reactions , respectively . these plots prove the linear free energy relationships \n ( lfers ) between catalyst acceleration \n and acidity among catalysts of very similar structure . in general , these lfers exhibited a narrow range of  values \n ( 0.390.47 ; table 5 ) , indicating a similar degree of hydrogen - bonding in the \n transition states and that these reactions are not proceeding through \n formal protonation (  = 1 ) . slightly higher values found for \n benzoic acids in the diels  alder (  = 0.57 ) indicate \n a greater degree of proton transfer in the transition states consistent \n with the ionic nature of benzoic acids . lower values for ureas in \n the friedel  crafts (  = 0.31 ) indicate a lesser degree \n of proton transfer in the transition states in line with the covalent \n nature of the n  h bonds . brnsted catalysis plot for the \n diels  alder reaction , \n demonstrating lfers for closely related catalyst groups . more significantly , these figures clearly demonstrate \n the inherent \n limitations of estimating catalyst strength using acidity metrics . \n based solely on pka measurements , thioureas \n would be predicted to provide much higher activity . in practice , the \n opposite is observed where ureas exhibited greater ( 6 , 7 vs 2 , 3 ) or similar ( 8 vs 4 ) activation of the nitro group compared \n to their thiourea analogues , despite the much greater acidity of the \n thioureas ( 45 orders of magnitude difference ) . highly reactive \n catalysts not belonging to a clearly defined series , including common \n brnsted acids , are included in figure 11 and further highlight the disparity between acidity and activity . \n interestingly , takenaka s azaindolium catalyst 14 displayed much higher activity than ppts , despite similar acidities \n and similar pyridinium  in conclusion , a sensor is described that provides \n an assessment \n of the reactivity over 34 orders of magnitude for 33 hydrogen - bonding \n catalysts . useful correlations are obtained between the wavelength \n shifts that catalysts cause to the pyrazinone sensor and the rate - determining \n steps in diels  alder and friedel  crafts reactions . as \n a result , only the wavelength shifts upon saturation of the sensor \n with catalysts need to be measured vs the more time - consuming titration \n studies . consequently , the sensor may also find use as a rapid means \n for measuring pka values in series of \n related compounds . in contrast to established acidity ( pka ) values , the sensor wavelength shift is a \n highly predictive metric \n for the relative reactivity of catalysts encompassing a broad range \n of structures and strengths . notable acidity - activity disparities \n include cationic catalysts ( low acidity , high reactivity ) , and benzoic \n acids ( high acidity , low reactivity ) , the strengths of which are more \n accurately gauged by their interaction with the sensor . overall , the \n sensor is a superior surrogate for the diverse electrophiles ( enone \n and nitroalkene ) used compared to water and is better able to assess \n secondary interactions . the data collected was used to formulate the \n relationship described in eq 3 , which provides \n a direct means of assessing the reactivity of a catalyst in a given \n reaction using the sensor signal . the resulting parameters also reveal \n relationships between substratecatalyst binding , catalyst - induced \n lumo - lowering , and catalyst structure . investigation of additional \n catalyzed reactions with the sensor , \n empirically or computationally , has the potential to expand eq 3 to achieve quantitative predictive power across \n a large range of reaction platforms and catalysts ( hydrogen bonding , \n brnsted acid , and lewis acid ) .",

A New Jersey woman is lucky to be alive after being rescued from her overturned vehicle just as it started to catch fire.

When officers Mark Ehrenberg and Ricky Ferriola arrived on scene, smoke was already coming out of the woman's white 2006 Toyota Solara convertible, which had been turned upside down. The vehicle's horn was honking but when one of the officers ran over and shouted at the driver, it was apparant that she has been knocked out in the crash. With smoke already coming from the vehicle the officers had to act fast to get the injured woman free. It took two minutes for the cops to cut the woman from her seat belt and pull her limp body from the wreckage.

    "document": "The Republic of Kosovo declared independence from Serbia in 2008, nearly a decade after the end of a brief but lethal conflict between Serbian forces and a Kosovo Albanian insurgency led by the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA). Since 2008, Kosovo has been recognized by more than 100 countries. The United States and most European Union (EU) member states recognize Kosovo. Serbia, Russia, China, and various other countries (including some EU member states) do not. The United States has strongly supported Kosovo's state-building and development efforts, as well as its ongoing dialogue with Serbia to normalize their relations. Kosovo regards the United States as a security guarantor and key ally. Congress has maintained interest in Kosovo for many decades\u00e2\u0080\u0094from concerns over Serbia's treatment of ethnic Albanians in the former Yugoslavia to the armed conflict in Kosovo in 1998-1999 after the Yugoslav federation disintegrated. Many Members were active in debates over the U.S.- and NATO-led military intervention in the conflict. After Serbian forces withdrew in 1999, many Members backed Kosovo's independence. Today, many in Congress continue to support Kosovo through country- or region-specific hearings, congressional visits, and foreign assistance funding levels averaging around $50 million per year since 2015. Looking ahead, Members may consider how the United States can support the Kosovo-Serbia dialogue, Kosovo's Euro-Atlantic ambitions, transitional justice processes, the ongoing political crisis arising from the March 2020 government collapse, and regional security. Current key issues in Kosovo's domestic situation include the March 2020 collapse of the government; responding to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic; managing relations with the country's ethnic Serb minority, particularly in northern Kosovo; and economic growth. Kosovo is a parliamentary republic with a prime minister, who serves as head of government, and an indirectly elected president, who serves as head of state and has largely ceremonial powers. The unicameral National Assembly has 120 seats, of which 20 are reserved for ethnic minorities. Albin Kurti currently serves as acting Prime Minister. In 2016, the National Assembly elected Hashim Tha\u00c3\u00a7i to a five-year term as president. Tha\u00c3\u00a7i previously served as prime minister and has long been a major political figure in the country. Kosovo's domestic politics have been volatile for much of the past year, marked by government turnover, escalating tension between the president and prime minister, and divisions over various issues\u00e2\u0080\u0094including a stalled dialogue to normalize relations with Serbia. More recently, the country entered a period of uncertainty when the Kurti government lost a vote of confidence on March 25, 2020, less than two months after it had formed (see textbox below, \"March 2020 Government Collapse and Aftermath\"). Many had viewed that government as a potentially pivotal shift in power from long-ruling parties to the opposition. The government breakdown coincided with the COVID-19 pandemic, and some have expressed concern that the ensuing political crisis could impede the public health response. Outgoing governing partners Vet\u00c3\u00abvendosje and the Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK) were the top-performing parties in early parliamentary elections in October 2019 (see Table 1 ). Their victory was considered to reflect deep voter dissatisfaction with corruption and economic conditions, as well as a desire to hold accountable the small number of parties that have largely rotated in government over the past several decades. Prior to 2020, the Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK), led by Tha\u00c3\u00a7i until 2016, had participated in all governments since independence. The PDK and several other former ruling parties grew out of factions of the KLA resistance and, along with several other parties, sometimes are referred to as the war wing . Critics charge that these parties became entrenched in state institutions. By contrast, neither Vet\u00c3\u00abvendosje nor its leader, Albin Kurti, had been in national government prior to 2020. The party grew out of a 2000s-era protest movement that channeled popular frustration with government corruption. Vet\u00c3\u00abvendosje also railed against aspects of post-1999 administration of Kosovo, accusing international missions of failing to establish the rule of law despite their vast powers. The party has steadily built support across election cycles. In the past, Vet\u00c3\u00abvendosje was criticized for using obstructionist tactics (including releasing tear gas in parliament) and for seeking to subvert several agreements with Serbia and Montenegro that were seen as important to regional reconciliation. Kurti maintains that the party will govern responsibly and prioritize socioeconomic reforms and the rule of law. Vet\u00c3\u00abvendosje at times has floated the idea of eventual unification with Kosovo's neighbor and close ally, Albania; however, unification does not appear likely to become a serious proposal under current conditions, not least of all due to U.S. and EU objections. Analysts generally have been positive in their assessments of Kosovo's democratic development since 2008, particularly its active civil society, pluralistic media sector, and track record of competitive elections. At the same time, U.S. and EU officials, as well as watchdog groups such as the U.S.-based nongovernmental organization Freedom House, have urged Kosovo to more rigorously enforce anti-corruption rules and uphold judicial independence. Many regard corruption and weak rule of law to be serious problems. The so-called Pronto Affair, one of several scandals to emerge in recent years, raised allegations of nepotism on the part of the then-governing PDK. In 2018, 11 PDK officials, including a minister and a lawmaker, were indicted for allegedly offering public jobs to party backers. According to the U.S.-based nongovernmental organization Freedom House, the Pronto case showed \"a systemic abuse of power and informal control over state structures.\" In April 2020, 19 individuals (thought to include former ministers) were indicted for abuse of position relating to the 2013 privatization of four hydropower plants and a distribution network. About 100,000 to 120,000 Serbs live in Kosovo, primarily in semi-isolated rural communities. Kosovo Serbs are accorded various forms of representation and partial autonomy under the 2008 constitution and related legislation. This framework is partly the result of U.S. and other external pressure on Kosovo's leaders to incorporate power-sharing measures to bolster minority rights and protection. These provisions established a municipal level of governance with specific areas of responsibility (most Serbs live in municipalities where they form a majority). Power-sharing arrangements require Serb representation in parliament, the executive, and other institutions. Majority consent from minority members of parliament is mandatory on some votes, and Serbian has official language status. Nevertheless, some question the actual effectiveness of these measures in integrating Serbs. More than half of Kosovo Serbs live in minority-majority municipalities in central and southeastern Kosovo. These municipalities do not border Serbia and are largely integrated into Kosovo institutions, although wartime legacies of distrust and fear persist. By contrast, the situation in northern Kosovo is one of the most enduring challenges in Kosovo's state building since independence (see also \"Relations with Serbia,\" below). About 40% of the Serb population lives in four Serb-majority municipalities north of the Ibar River that are adjacent to Serbia (see map in Figure 1 ). Pristina has been unable to exert full authority in northern Kosovo, whereas Serbia has retained strong influence (albeit not full authority) in the region despite the withdrawal of its forces in 1999. Kosovo Serbs turned to Serbian-supported parallel structures for security, health care, education, and other services. Due to its grey-zone status, northern Kosovo is considered a regional hub for smuggling and other illicit activities. Serbian List ( Srpska Lista ), the party that has dominated recent elections in northern Kosovo, is considered to be close to the Serbian government. There have been reports of harassment and intimidation against opposition Serb politicians in the north, most recently in the October 2019 elections. The 2018 murder of opposition Serb politician Oliver Ivanovi\u00c4\u0087 raised questions about the power structures and vested interests that prevail in northern Kosovo. The 1998-1999 war with Serbia caused extensive damage to Kosovo's infrastructure and economy. Two decades later, economic recovery continues. Employment is an acute policy challenge; Kosovo's average 40% labor force participation rate is the lowest in the Western Balkans. The unemployment rate stood at about 26% in 2019, with disproportionately higher levels among working-age females and youth. The economy and perceived limits to upward socioeconomic mobility contribute to high rates of emigration. Kosovo's gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 3.8% in 2018 and 4.2% in 2019. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimates that Kosovo's economy could contract by 5% in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Foreign direct investment (FDI) in Kosovo in 2018 was \u00e2\u0082\u00ac214 million (about $232 million), the lowest in the Western Balkans. By contrast, remittances received from citizens abroad (primarily in European countries) amounted to \u00e2\u0082\u00ac801 million (about $868.6 million) in 2018, equivalent to 12% of GDP. Kosovo's key trade partners are the EU and neighboring countries in the Western Balkans. Kosovo has largely liberalized trade with both blocs through its Stabilization and Association Agreement with the EU (a cooperation framework that includes steps to liberalize trade) and as a signatory to the Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA) alongside other non-EU Balkan countries. Kosovo's 2019 exports totaled about \u00e2\u0082\u00ac382 million ($414 million), of which the largest shares went to CEFTA countries and the EU. India, Switzerland, and Turkey were other significant export markets. Kosovo's top exports are metals; mineral products; plastics and rubber; and prepared foods, beverages, and tobacco. In lobbying for greater FDI, Kosovo officials tout the country's young workforce, natural resources, low corporate tax rate, use of the euro, and preferential access to the EU market. However, various impediments to investment remain, including corruption, weak rule of law, uncertainties over Kosovo's dispute with Serbia, and energy supply disruptions. Kosovo declared independence from Serbia in 2008 with U.S. support. Serbia does not recognize Kosovo and relies on Russia in particular for diplomatic support. Many believe that the lack of normalized relations between Kosovo and Serbia impedes both countries' prosperity and progress toward EU membership and imperils Western Balkan stability. After centuries of Ottoman rule, Kosovo became part of Serbia in the early 20 th century. After World War II, Kosovo eventually had the status of a province of Serbia, one of six republics of Yugoslavia. Some Serbian perspectives view Kosovo's incorporation as the rightful return of territory that was the center of a medieval Serbian kingdom and is prominent in national identity narratives. Kosovo Albanian perspectives, by contrast, largely view Kosovo's incorporation into Serbia as an annexation that resulted in the marginalization of the Albanian-majority population. During the 1980s, Kosovo Albanians grew increasingly mobilized and sought separation from Serbia. In 1989, Serbia\u00e2\u0080\u0094then led by autocrat Slobodan Milo\u00c5\u00a1evi\u00c4\u0087, who leveraged Serbian nationalism to consolidate power\u00e2\u0080\u0094imposed direct rule in Kosovo. Throughout the 1990s, amid Yugoslavia's violent breakup and Milo\u00c5\u00a1evi\u00c4\u0087's continued grip on power in Serbia, human rights groups condemned Serbian repression of Albanians in Kosovo, including suppression of the Albanian language and culture, mass arrests, and purges of Albanians from the public sector and education institutions. In the late 1990s, the Albanian-led Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) launched an insurgency against Serbian rule in Kosovo. Serbia responded with increasingly heavy force in 1998 and 1999 (see \"Transitional Justice,\" below). Following a NATO air campaign against Serbian targets in early 1999, Serbia agreed to end hostilities and withdraw its forces from Kosovo. U.N. Security Council (UNSC) Resolution 1244 authorized the U.N. Interim Administration Mission (UNMIK) to provide transitional civil administration and the NATO-led KFOR mission to provide security (both missions still operate on a smaller scale). Milo\u00c5\u00a1evi\u00c4\u0087 lost power in 2000 amid mass protests in Serbia. Kosovo's decision to declare independence in 2008 followed protracted and ultimately unsuccessful efforts on the part of the international community to broker a settlement with Serbia. Serbia challenged Kosovo's actions before the International Court of Justice (ICJ); however, the ICJ's 2010 advisory opinion found that Kosovo had not contravened international law. Following the ICJ ruling, the EU and the United States urged Kosovo and Serbia to participate in a dialogue aimed at eventual normalization of relations, but with an initial focus on technical measures to facilitate the movement of goods and people and otherwise improve the quality of life. In 2012, the talks advanced to a political level, bringing together leaders from the two countries for EU-brokered meetings. Leaders in both countries are constrained by public opinion and a political climate that tends to make major concessions costly. Kosovo and Serbia's goal to join the EU helps incentivize their participation in the dialogue; the EU maintains that neither country can join the union until they normalize relations. Kosovo's participation in the dialogue also is motivated by its desire to clear a path to U.N. membership and, eventually, NATO membership (Serbian approval is seen as a key step to unlocking Kosovo's U.N. membership). To date, the dialogue has produced 33 agreements, mostly of a technical nature. In 2013, Serbia and Kosovo reached the Brussels Agreement, which set out principles to normalize relations, including measures to dismantle Serbian-backed parallel structures in northern Kosovo and create an Association of Serb Municipalities (ASM) linking Kosovo's 10 Serb-majority municipalities. Implementation of the dialogue's agreements has progressed in some areas, such as Kosovo Serb electoral participation and the integration of law enforcement and the judiciary in the north into statewide institutions. It has lagged in other areas, such as in the energy sector and in the ASM. Although the dialogue format does not predetermine a specific outcome, the EU has urged a \"comprehensive, legally binding\" agreement between the parties. Two particularly thorny issues in any such agreement are the scope of Serbian recognition of Kosovo and the situation in northern Kosovo. It remains undetermined whether Serbia would fully recognize Kosovo or accept Kosovo's institutions and U.N. membership without formal recognition. It is also uncertain how northern Kosovo would be addressed in any final settlement. Prior to 2018 (see below), U.S. and EU officials rejected local (primarily Serbian) leaders' occasional hints at partition as a potential solution. The United States and the EU feared that transferring territory or changing borders along ethnic lines could set a dangerous precedent and destabilize the region. Alternatively, some consider the integration of the north into statewide institutions through autonomy measures, such as the ASM, to be a potential compromise that could preserve Kosovo's territorial integrity while offering concessions to Kosovo Serbs. However, the ASM has faced resistance from some in Kosovo due to concerns that it could undermine state integrity if it is endowed with significant executive functions and formalized links to Serbia. Since late 2015, there has been little progress in reaching new agreements or implementing existing ones. Further, a shift in focus absorbed some of the dialogue's energies: in 2018, President Tha\u00c3\u00a7i and Serbian President Aleksandar Vu\u00c4\u008di\u00c4\u0087 raised the prospect of redrawing borders as an approach to normalizing relations (sometimes described as a land swap , a partition, or a border adjustment ). Analysts believe such a measure could entail transferring Serb-majority municipalities in northern Kosovo to Serbia, possibly in exchange for Albanian-majority areas of Serbia's Pre\u00c5\u00a1evo Valley. To the surprise of some, Trump Administration officials broke with long-standing U.S. and EU opposition to redrawing borders/partition by signaling willingness to consider such a proposal if Kosovo and Serbia were to reach a mutually satisfactory agreement. However, some European allies, particularly Germany, remain opposed to any such proposal. Acting Prime Minister Kurti and much of Kosovo's political class and population also oppose ceding territory. The dialogue has been suspended since late 2018, when Kosovo imposed tariffs on Serbian goods in retaliation for Serbia's campaign to block Kosovo's Interpol membership bid and its efforts to lobby countries to \"de-recognize\" Kosovo. Serbian leaders say they will not return to negotiations until the tariffs are lifted. U.S. and European officials repeatedly called upon the two parties to return to talks. In March 2020, Prime Minister Kurti announced the repeal of tariffs on raw material imports from Serbia. The following month, amid continued U.S. pressure, he announced the decision to conditionally repeal tariffs against Serbian goods and replace them with gradual reciprocity measures to match existing Serbian measures impacting the movement of goods and people. EU officials welcomed the tariff removal; however, U.S. officials expressed dissatisfaction with the reciprocity measures. Kosovo's parties and leaders have become increasingly divided over several aspects of the dialogue, particularly the terms of lifting tariffs against Serbia. Furthermore, acting Prime Minister Kurti has challenged President Tha\u00c3\u00a7i's leadership of Kosovo's participation in the dialogue, arguing that the authority of the government (rather than the head of state) to lead efforts was confirmed in a prior Constitutional Court ruling. Separately, some observers caution that growing uncertainty over the Western Balkan countries' EU membership prospects could alter the incentive structure weaving together the dialogue and the accession process. Recently, the United States has played a more direct role in Kosovo-Serbia negotiations (see \"U.S.-Kosovo Relations\"). Transitional justice relating to the 1998-1999 war is a sensitive, emotionally charged issue in Kosovo and Serbia and a source of friction in efforts to normalize relations. Serbian police, soldiers, and paramilitary forces were accused of systematic, intentional human rights violations during the conflict. About 13,000 people were killed, and nearly half of the population was forcibly driven out of Kosovo. An estimated 20,000 people were victims of conflict-related sexual violence. The vast majority of all victims were ethnic Albanians. On a smaller scale, some KLA fighters\u00e2\u0080\u0094particularly at the local level\u00e2\u0080\u0094carried out retributive acts of violence against Serb civilians, other minority civilians, and Albanian civilians whom they viewed as collaborators. Before closing in 2017, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia tried several high-profile cases relating to the Kosovo conflict, including those of deposed Serbian leader Milo\u00c5\u00a1evi\u00c4\u0087, who died before his trial finished, and former Kosovo Prime Minister Haradinaj, who was twice acquitted of charges relating to his role as a KLA commander. Domestic courts in Kosovo and Serbia now handle most war crimes cases. Weak law enforcement and judicial cooperation between Kosovo and Serbia is an impediment in the many cases in which evidence, witnesses, victims, and alleged perpetrators are no longer in Kosovo. Critics assert that low political will in Serbia in particular hampers transitional justice. Officials from successive post-Milo\u00c5\u00a1evi\u00c4\u0087 Serbian governments have been criticized for downplaying or failing to acknowledge Serbia's role in the wars in Bosnia, Croatia, and Kosovo in the 1990s and for fostering a climate that is hostile to transitional justice and societal reconciliation with the past. Transitional justice processes concerning the KLA are controversial in Kosovo. Under U.S. and EU pressure, in 2015 the National Assembly adopted a constitutional amendment and legislation to create the Kosovo Specialist Chambers and Specialist Prosecutor's Office. These institutions are part of Kosovo's judicial system but are primarily staffed by international jurists and located in The Hague, Netherlands, to allay concerns over witness intimidation and political pressure. They are to investigate the findings of a 2011 Council of Europe report concerning allegations of war crimes committed by some KLA units. The Specialist Chambers is controversial in Kosovo, because it is to try only alleged KLA crimes. In 2017, lawmakers from the then-governing coalition moved to abrogate the Specialist Chambers but backed down after the United States and allies warned that doing so would have \"severe negative consequences.\" More than 120 former KLA fighters are reported to have received summons for questioning during 2019, and analysts believe some Kosovo politicians could face indictment. The EU and NATO have played key roles in Kosovo; these institutional relationships continue to evolve alongside Kosovo's state-building processes. The EU has played a large role in Kosovo's postwar development. A European Union Rule of Law Mission (EULEX) was launched in 2008, assuming some tasks that UNMIK had carried out since 1999. The mission's scope has decreased over time as domestic institutions assume more responsibilities; today, EULEX's primary role is to monitor and advise on rule-of-law issues, with some executive functions. EULEX's current mandate runs through June 2020. Additionally, the EU provided over \u00e2\u0082\u00ac1.48 billion (about $1.6 billion) in assistance from 2007 to 2020, as well as emergency support to address the COVID-19 pandemic (see \"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Response\"). Kosovo is a potential candidate for EU membership and signed a Stabilization and Association agreement with the EU in 2014. The next steps in Kosovo's EU membership bid are obtaining candidate status and launching accession negotiations, which would commence the lengthy process of harmonizing domestic legislation with that of the EU. Kosovo's EU membership bid is complicated by the fact that five EU member states do not recognize it. Kosovo's more immediate goal in its relationship with the EU is to obtain for its citizens visa-free entry into the EU's Schengen area of free movement, which allows individuals to travel without passport checks between most European countries. Kosovo is the only Western Balkan country that does not have this status, despite EU officials' assessment that it fulfilled key requirements in 2018. Some observers contend that the EU's continued denial of visa liberalization to Kosovo has undercut the bloc's credibility and influence in the country. The NATO-led Kosovo Force (KFOR) was launched in 1999 with 50,000 troops as a peace-support operation with a mandate under UNSC Resolution 1244. KFOR's current role is to maintain safety and security, support free movement of citizens, and facilitate Kosovo's Euro-Atlantic integration. As the security situation in Kosovo improved, NATO defense ministers in 2009 resolved to shift KFOR's posture toward a deterrent presence. Some of KFOR's functions have been transferred to the Kosovo Police. The United States remains the largest contributor to KFOR, providing about 660 of the 3,500 troops deployed as of November 2019. Any changes to the size of the mission would require approval from the North Atlantic Council and be \"dictated by continued positive conditions on the ground.\" Many analysts assert that KFOR continues to play an important role in regional security. KFOR has played a key role in developing the lightly armed Kosovo Security Force (KSF) and bringing it to full operational capacity. KSF's current role is largely nonmilitary in nature and is focused instead on emergency response. A recurring issue is how KSF may transform into a regular army. In December 2018, Kosovo lawmakers amended existing legislation to gradually transform KSF, drawing sharp objections from Kosovo Serb leaders and Serbia. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg called the measure \"ill timed\" given heightened tensions with Serbia, cautioned that the decision could jeopardize cooperation with NATO, and expressed concern that the decisionmaking process had not been inclusive. The United States, however, expressed support for the Kosovo government's decision and urged officials to ensure that the transformation is gradual and inclusive of all communities. The United States enjoys broad popularity in Kosovo due to its support during the Milo\u00c5\u00a1evi\u00c4\u0087 era, its leadership of NATO's 1999 intervention in the Kosovo war, its backing of Kosovo's independence in 2008, and its subsequent diplomatic support. The United States supports Kosovo's Euro-Atlantic ambitions. Kosovo regards the United States as a security guarantor and critical ally, and many believe the United States retains influence in domestic policymaking and politics. The Trump Administration has signaled growing interest in securing a deal to resolve the Kosovo-Serbia dispute and stepping up U.S. engagement in the Western Balkans more broadly. U.S. officials assert that the full normalization of Kosovo-Serbia relations is a \"strategic priority.\" In August 2019, U.S. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo appointed Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Matthew Palmer as his Special Representative for the Western Balkans. Shortly thereafter, President Donald Trump appointed U.S. Ambassador to Germany (now also Acting Director of National Intelligence) Richard Grenell as Special Presidential Envoy for Serbia and Kosovo Peace Negotiations. Many officials in Kosovo and Serbia have welcomed the prospect of a greater U.S. role in efforts to normalize relations. In January 2020, U.S. officials announced two new Kosovo-Serbia agreements on transportation links, pursuant to a strategy that focuses on economic growth and job creation as foundations for the normalization process. In March 2020, the White House hosted informal talks between President Tha\u00c3\u00a7i and President Vu\u00c4\u008di\u00c4\u0087. U.S. efforts currently center on bringing the two parties back to negotiations. As mentioned, U.S. officials criticized the reciprocity principles that acting Prime Minister Kurti announced in April 2020 alongside the conditional lifting of tariffs. The direct U.S. role in brokering the recent transportation agreements and greater U.S. involvement in efforts to normalize Kosovo-Serbia relations is largely a departure from the approach taken under previous Administrations, which strongly supported EU-led efforts to normalize relations but did not play a formal, direct role. News of the January 2020 U.S.-brokered agreements reportedly came as a surprise to some European officials, who in turn have underscored the EU's long-standing role in the normalization process and appointed an EU special representative for the dialogue. Some analysts, while welcoming greater U.S. involvement, assert that the United States is more effective in engaging the Western Balkans when its actions and positions are aligned with those of its European allies; they contend that recent gaps between the United States and allies such as Germany on the Kosovo-Serbia dialogue, as well as on the March 2020 no-confidence session, have undercut overall engagement efforts. Some observers and several Members of Congress have expressed concern over recent U.S. policies toward Kosovo's government, such as pausing implementation of a $49 million Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) Threshold Program and delaying the development of its proposed Compact Program, until Kosovo rescinds the tariffs. Some Kosovo officials expressed dismay over what they describe as U.S. pressure on Kosovo to lift tariffs against Serbia without equivalent pressure on Serbia to cease its campaign to undercut Kosovo's international legitimacy. On April 13, 2020, the Chairman of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations released a joint letter to Secretary Pompeo that welcomed greater U.S. diplomatic engagement in efforts to normalize relations between Kosovo and Serbia but expressed concern over what they described as \"heavy-handed\" treatment of the weeks-old Kurti government. They urged greater cooperation with the EU and restarting implementation of Kosovo's MCC Threshold Program. Separately, acting Prime Minister Kurti alleged that U.S. officials had aided efforts to unseat his government in the March 2020 no-confidence session in hopes that a more pliable government in Pristina would quickly reach a deal with Serbia. U.S. officials have underscored that the United States is \"committed to working with any government formed through the constitutional process\" and rejected speculation that the United States was brokering a \"secret plan for land swaps.\" The United States is a significant source of foreign assistance to Kosovo (see Figure 2 ). U.S. assistance aims to support the implementation of agreements from the Kosovo-Serbia dialogue and to improve transparent and responsive governance, among other goals. Additional assistance is provided through a $49 million Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) Threshold Program that launched in 2017, with focus on governance and energy efficiency and reliability. Threshold programs are intended to help countries become eligible to participate in a larger Compact Program; in December 2018 and again in December 2019, the MCC board determined that Kosovo was eligible to participate in a compact. As discussed above, MCC assistance is currently on hold. The United States and Kosovo cooperate to combat transnational threats and bolster security. Like elsewhere in the Western Balkans, Kosovo is a transit country and in some cases a source country for trafficking in humans, contraband smuggling (including illicit drugs), and other criminal activities. Observers consider Kosovo to have a relatively strong legal framework to counter trafficking, smuggling, and other transborder crimes. At the same time, the United States and the EU have urged officials in Kosovo to better implement the country's domestic laws by more strenuously investigating, prosecuting, and convicting traffickers, as well as by improving victim support. Combatting terrorism and violent extremism is a core area of U.S.-Kosovo security cooperation. Kosovo is a secular state with a moderate Islamic tradition, but an estimated 400 Kosovo citizens traveled to Syria and Iraq in the 2010s to support the Islamic State amid the terrorist group's growing recruitment efforts. As this policy challenge emerged, the United States assisted Kosovo with tightening its legal framework to combat recruitment, foreign fighter travel, and terrorism financing, as well as strengthening its countering violent extremism strategy. The United States provides support to Kosovo law enforcement and judicial institutions to combat terrorism and extremism. The State Department's Antiterrorism Assistance program, for example, has provided training or capacity-building support for the Kosovo Police's Counterterrorism Directorate and for the Border Police. Kosovo and the United States agreed to an extradition treaty in March 2016. In April 2019, the United States provided diplomatic and logistical support for the repatriation of about 110 Kosovo citizens from Syria\u00e2\u0080\u0094primarily women and children\u00e2\u0080\u0094who had supported the Islamic State or were born to parents who had. Some repatriated persons were indicted on terrorism-related charges. Kosovo has a sister-state relationship with Iowa that grew out of a 2011 State Partnership Program (SPP) between the Iowa National Guard and the Kosovo Security Force. That relationship has been hailed as a \"textbook example\" of the scope and aims of the SPP. Congressional interest in Kosovo predates Yugoslavia's disintegration. Through resolutions, hearings, and congressional delegations, many Members of Congress highlighted the status of ethnic Albanian minorities in Yugoslavia, engaged in heated debates over intervention during the Clinton Administration, urged the George W. Bush Administration to back Kosovo's independence, and supported continued financial assistance. Congressional interest and support continues. In the 116 th Congress, several hearings have addressed Kosovo in part or in whole, including an April 2019 House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing on Kosovo's wartime victims and recent hearings on Western Balkan issues held by the Senate Armed Services Committee and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee's Subcommittee on Europe and Regional Security Cooperation. Given Kosovo's geography, history, and current challenges, the country also factors into wider U.S. foreign policy issues in which Congress remains engaged. Such issues include transitional justice, corruption and the rule of law, combatting human trafficking and organized crime, U.S. foreign assistance, security in Europe, and EU and NATO enlargement.

    "human_reference": "Kosovo, a country in the Western Balkans with a predominantly Albanian-speaking population, declared independence from Serbia in 2008, less than a decade after a brief but lethal war. It has since been recognized by about 100 countries. The United States and most European Union (EU) member states recognize Kosovo. Serbia, Russia, China, and various other countries (including some EU member states) do not. Key issues for Kosovo include the following: Resuming talks with Serbia. An EU-facilitated dialogue between Kosovo and Serbia, aimed at normalization of relations, stalled in 2018 when Kosovo imposed tariffs on Serbian goods in response to Serbia's efforts to undermine Kosovo's international legitimacy. Despite U.S. and EU pressure, the parties have not resumed talks. On April 1, 2020, acting Prime Minister Albin Kurti conditionally lifted tariffs against Serbian imports; this step was praised by EU officials but drew U.S. criticism because of the government's simultaneous pledge to gradually introduce measures to match Serbian barriers to the movement of goods and people. Government collapse . The governing coalition led by Albin Kurti of the Self-Determination Party (Vet\u00c3\u00abvendosje) lost a vote of confidence in March 2020, less than two months after it had formed. The outgoing government comprises two parties formerly in opposition, both of which had campaigned on an anti-corruption platform. Among other factors, the collapse was attributed to divisions over managing relations with Serbia amid U.S. pressure on the government to immediately lift tariffs against Serbian imports, as well as to domestic political infighting. Kosovo's leaders disagree over how to proceed from the current political crisis. Strengthening the rule of law. The victory of Kurti's Vet\u00c3\u00abvendosje in the October 2019 election partly reflected widespread voter dissatisfaction with corruption. Weakness in the rule of law contributes to Kosovo's difficulties in attracting foreign investment and complicates the country's efforts to combat transnational threats. Relations with the United States. Kosovo regards the United States as a key ally and security guarantor. Kosovo receives the largest share of U.S. foreign assistance to the Balkans, and the two countries cooperate on numerous security issues. The United States is the largest contributor of troops to the NATO-led Kosovo Force (KFOR), which has contributed to security in Kosovo since 1999. In 2019, the Trump Administration appointed a Special Representative for the Western Balkans and a Special Presidential Envoy for Serbia and Kosovo Peace Negotiations. These appointments are considered to reflect the Administration's interest in securing a comprehensive settlement between Kosovo and Serbia and may signal a potentially greater U.S. role in a process that the EU has largely facilitated to date. Leaders in Kosovo generally have welcomed greater U.S. engagement, but some observers expressed concern over reported U.S. pressure on the Kurti government to lift tariffs on Serbian goods\u00e2\u0080\u0094including pausing some U.S. assistance to Kosovo\u00e2\u0080\u0094and over perceived U.S. support for the no-confidence session that resulted in the March 2020 government collapse. U.S. officials maintain that the United States is committed to working with any government formed in compliance with constitutional processes. Transatlantic cooperation . Since the Kosovo war ended in 1999, the United States, the EU, and key EU member states have largely coordinated their efforts to promote regional stability in the Western Balkans, including efforts to normalize relations between Kosovo and Serbia. More recently, however, some observers have expressed concern that transatlantic coordination has weakened on some issues relating to the Kosovo-Serbia dialogue and to Kosovo's current political impasse. Congress was actively involved in debates over the U.S. response to a 1998-1999 conflict in Kosovo and subsequently supported Kosovo's declaration of independence. Today, many Members of Congress continue to support Kosovo through country- or region-specific hearings, congressional visits, and foreign assistance funding levels averaging around $50 million per year since 2015.",

    "document": "Taxpayers who elect to itemize their deductions may reduce their federal income tax liability by claiming a deduction for certain state and local taxes paid, often called the \"SALT deduction.\" The 2017 tax revision (commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, TCJA; P.L. 115-97 ) established a temporary $10,000 limit, or \"SALT cap,\" on annual SALT deduction claims. By limiting the amount of the SALT deduction, the SALT cap increases the tax liability of certain taxpayers, which increases federal tax revenues relative to what otherwise would have been collected without a limitation in place. The SALT cap's effect on tax liability varies significantly with taxpayer income and with state and local tax rates. A number of bills introduced in the 116 th Congress would modify the SALT cap, and federal regulatory efforts responding to related state and local government activity are ongoing. This report discusses the SALT cap's features, analyzes its potential impact, and summarizes recent legislation and regulatory action to modify the cap. Under current law, taxpayers itemizing deductions (in lieu of claiming the standard deduction) may reduce their taxable income by claiming the SALT deduction for certain state and local taxes paid during the tax year. The state and local taxes eligible for the SALT deduction are income taxes, sales taxes (claimed in lieu of income taxes), personal property taxes, and certain real property taxes not paid in the carrying on of a trade or business. For taxpayers who would have itemized deductions without access to the SALT deduction, it generates tax savings equal to the amount deducted multiplied by the taxpayer's marginal income tax rate. For example, a taxpayer with $20,000 of eligible state and local taxes and a top marginal tax rate of 35% would save $7,000 from the SALT deduction (i.e., $20,000*0.35). For taxpayers who would have claimed the standard deduction without access to the SALT deduction, it generates tax savings equal to the difference between their tax liability if they had claimed the standard deduction and their total tax liability with itemized deductions (inclusive of the SALT deduction). (Throughout this report, the tax savings attributable to the SALT deduction is also referred to as the benefit from the deduction.) The TCJA established a temporary SALT cap for tax years 2018 through 2025. The SALT cap is set at $10,000 for single taxpayers or married couples filing jointly and $5,000 for married taxpayers filing separately. By limiting the SALT deduction available to certain taxpayers, the SALT cap decreases the tax savings associated with the deduction relative to prior law, thereby increasing federal revenues. The TCJA also changed a number of tax code features (e.g., standard deduction amounts, marginal tax rates) that indirectly affect SALT deduction eligibility and the value of the tax savings it generates. The TCJA roughly doubled the standard deduction and limited other itemized deductions. The TCJA also prohibited SALT deduction claims on taxes paid on foreign real property for tax years 2018 through 2025. The SALT cap, the increased value of the standard deduction, and other tax changes enacted by the TCJA have reduced the number of taxpayers claiming the SALT deduction and the total tax savings from those claims. Table 1 shows the most recent estimates of reductions in federal revenues attributable to the SALT deduction for FY2017, the last full year before enactment of P.L. 115-97 , and FY2019 through FY2023. Revenue losses from the SALT deduction in FY2017 ($100.9 billion) nearly equaled the total losses projected from FY2019 through FY2023 ($117.2 billion). The Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) projects that 16.4 million taxpayers will claim a SALT deduction for tax year 2019, compared to 46.6 million taxpayers who the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) reported claiming the deduction in 2017. Recent research has estimated the SALT cap's effect on SALT deduction claims independent of other tax changes enacted through the TCJA. A 2019 Treasury Inspector General report examined the SALT cap's hypothetical effect had it been imposed in tax year 2017, prior to the other TCJA changes taking effect. The report found that the cap would have reduced SALT deduction benefits for 10.9 million taxpayers (about 25% of all households claiming the deduction) and reduced deduction amounts by $323 billion, or just over half of the actual amounts deducted in that year. In June 2019, JCT estimated that holding all other portions of the tax code constant, repealing the SALT cap for tax year 2018 would decrease FY2019 federal revenues by $77.4 billion. The SALT deduction provides state and local governments with an increased ability to levy taxes by reducing the after-tax cost of state and local taxes to taxpayers. By limiting the deduction's benefits, the SALT cap increases the cost (or \"price\") of state and local taxes for affected taxpayers. For example, consider a taxpayer with itemized deductions, a 35% marginal tax rate, and $20,000 in eligible SALT payments. Without a SALT cap in place, the net price of those taxes for the taxpayer would be $13,000 (or $20,000*[1-0.35]), as the taxpayer can use all $20,000 of those tax payments to reduce federal tax liability. When a $10,000 SALT cap is imposed, the final price of those taxes rises to $16,500 (or $10,000 + [$10,000*(1-0.35)]). The basic economic law of demand\u00e2\u0080\u0094there is an inverse relationship between the price of a good and the quantity demanded\u00e2\u0080\u0094suggests that by increasing the price of state and local taxes, a SALT cap would lead to a decline in demand for state and local government activity. The size of the decrease would be a function of the sensitivity of public desire for state and local services, paid for by taxes, to changes in the price of those services (i.e., the elasticity of demand). Research has found indications that state and local governments respond to federal tax changes with shifts in their own tax and spending practices. Response to the SALT cap could be a function of its salience , that is, the public awareness of its effect on tax liability. SALT cap salience may depend on awareness of the state and local taxes themselves, which can vary significantly across tax system features. Salience for taxpayers who take the standard deduction, but who would be better off itemizing deductions if not for the SALT cap, may be particularly low, as the SALT cap's effects may not be apparent in tax filing software. Taxpayers could also have difficulty differentiating SALT cap-related liability changes from other changes enacted through the TCJA. State and local governments are generally limited in their ability to respond to shifts in demand for government services with changes in fiscal outcomes (i.e., increased deficits or reduced surpluses). Unlike the federal government, which has no enforceable balanced-budget requirement, most state and local governments are statutorily required to balance operating revenues and operating expenses over a one-year or two-year period. Governments with a binding balanced-budget requirement would therefore need to match any reduction in SALT revenue resulting from the cap with a reduction in spending on services provided or increases in other revenue sources. This section explores features of localities and households that are likely to influence the distribution and intensity of SALT cap effects on tax liability. The recent enactment and implementation of the SALT cap means that tax return data on its impact by state, locality, and income level are currently unavailable. However, analyzing the SALT deduction's distribution prior to the cap's imposition can provide insight into its likely impact. The data indicate that the SALT cap's effects will vary significantly across state and local jurisdictions and household income. The SALT cap's effect is in part a function of state and local tax policies. For example, greater effective rates levied on taxes that qualify for the deduction (income taxes, general sales taxes, real and personal property taxes) would increase the amount of SALT-eligible tax payments and therefore increase the probability that a taxpayer will have SALT deductions that exceed the cap. State and local tax rates could thus affect both the number of taxpayers with higher tax liability from the SALT cap (sometimes referred to as SALT cap exposure) and the amount of those increases (sometimes referred to as the SALT cap burden). Differences in local incomes and price levels are another determinant of the SALT cap's effect. Wages and prices are the bases against which state and local governments levy SALT-eligible income, sales, and property taxes. Consider two households that are in separate localities and have different incomes but the same tax rates and the same purchasing power. In other words, adjusting for their local price levels, each household is able to purchase the same sets of goods and services. Although each household faces the same set of purchasing options on the public and private markets, the household facing higher price levels is more likely to have SALT payments in excess of the SALT cap. State and local governments raised a combined $1.30 trillion in individual income taxes, general sales taxes, and property taxes in 2017, an average of about $8,500 per federal income taxpayer. Those revenues are divided almost evenly between state governments ($667 billion in revenues), which collected the majority of the income and sales taxes, and local governments ($632 billion), which collected the majority of property taxes. There is considerable geographic variation in the rates at which taxes are levied and in the incomes and prices to which those taxes apply. Figure 1 shows effective state and local tax rates for all SALT-eligible taxes in each state, calculated as the percentage of total adjusted gross income paid in-state and local general sales taxes, individual income taxes, and property taxes. In 2017, New York (17.2% effective tax rate), Washington, DC (16.9%), Hawaii (16.1%), Maine (15.0%), and Nebraska (14.2%) had the highest combined effective state and local tax rates. Delaware (6.8%), Alaska (7.6%), Florida (7.7%), New Hampshire (8.3%) and Tennessee (8.4%) had the lowest combined tax rates. All else equal, states with higher SALT-eligible effective tax rates are likely to experience greater SALT cap effects on tax liability than states with lower rates. Figure 2 plots the average SALT deduction amount for each 2017 congressional district (districts are from the 115 th Congress). The districts with the 20 highest average SALT deductions are located in states with above-average effective tax rates in Figure 1 , including New York, California, Connecticut, and New Jersey. Nineteen of the districts with the 20 lowest average SALT deductions are located in Florida, Texas, Tennessee, Alabama, Nevada, Arizona, and Alaska, all states with below-average effective state and local tax rates. Figure 2 shows the potential significance of local tax and economic activity on the SALT cap's effects. Figure 3 adds a layer of analysis by plotting two variables on each congressional district: (1) average adjusted gross income (AGI) of taxpayers and (2) average effective SALT rates. Each district categorized as having low effective SALT rates in Figure 3 had an average AGI below $75,000, and 13 of these districts had average AGI below $50,000. Nineteen of the 20 districts with the highest effective SALT rates had an average AGI above $100,000, and four of the top five districts had an average AGI above $200,000. The distribution of SALT deductions across household income is discussed further in the next section. Figure 3 demonstrates the importance of considering both tax rates and the tax base when examining potential SALT cap effects. As with other tax deductions, SALT deduction benefits accrue more for higher-income taxpayers than lower-income taxpayers. Two factors explain this pattern: (1) higher incomes directly lead to more state and local income taxes and are correlated with higher sales and property tax payments stemming from greater consumption; and (2) taxpayers with higher incomes are subject to higher marginal tax rates, so each dollar deducted from tax liability results in greater tax savings. Table 2 shows the JCT projections of SALT benefits by income class in tax years 2017 (the last year before the TCJA took effect) and 2019. Taxpayers with more than $100,000 of AGI received the vast majority of SALT benefits in both 2017 (93%) and 2019 (89%). Taxpayers with income between $50,000 and $200,000 received a larger share of total benefits in 2019 (44%) than 2017 (29%), whereas the opposite trend occurs for taxpayers with more than $200,000 (declining from 71% to 56%). Taxpayers with less than $50,000 received relatively little benefit from the SALT deduction in both years. Data from Table 2 suggest that the SALT cap increased the federal tax burden of high-income taxpayers. This occurs because the SALT cap (1) reduced the number of taxpayers claiming the SALT deduction, who disproportionately fell in higher income classes; and (2) reduced SALT benefit levels of taxpayers with more than $10,000 in SALT payments, who were particularly likely to have high levels of income. JCT estimated that were the SALT cap eliminated in tax year 2019, more than half of the additional tax benefits would have been claimed by taxpayers with incomes exceeding $1 million. The SALT cap's total effect on the combined federal, state, and local tax burden across income levels will depend on the state and local government response to the SALT cap, which is uncertain. Figure 4 plots the percentage of all tax returns, the percentage of returns claiming SALT deductions, and the percentage of SALT deduction amounts claimed across income levels in tax year 2017, the latest year for which data are available. (The amount of SALT deduction claimed reflects the dollars deducted and not the tax savings associated with the deduction.) Tax returns with AGI exceeding $1 million represented less than 1% of all tax returns, but claimed over 25% of all SALT deduction amounts. Tax returns with over $100,000 in AGI claimed more than 78% of the SALT deduction amounts claimed, while returns with AGI below $50,000 claimed less than 10% of that total. The composition of state and local taxes also affects the SALT cap's ultimate effect on taxpayers within a local jurisdiction. Table 3 illustrates how SALT cap burden distribution can differ when the composition of state and local taxes changes while holding total tax revenue constant. In both jurisdictions, total tax revenues are $44,000. In Jurisdiction I, relatively high income tax rates generate higher income tax payments, and the SALT cap burden falls on Tax Units A and B, the taxpayers with higher incomes. In Jurisdiction II, property tax rates are higher than income tax rates, and the SALT cap burden instead falls on Tax Units A and C, the taxpayers with high property values. More of the state and local tax revenue in Jurisdiction II is above the SALT cap, meaning that taxpayers in Jurisdiction II are able to deduct less in SALT deductions on their federal income tax returns. This analysis highlights the importance of state and local tax structure in determining the SALT cap's effect on taxpayer liability even when holding the average level of taxes constant. The state and local response to the SALT cap's effect has varied across municipalities. Certain governments in states with relatively high mean SALT deduction values (see Figure 1 ) have either enacted legislation that would appear to make tax changes to reduce the SALT cap's effect on their taxpayers or taken legal action against the federal government. Recent federal and legal responses to some of these actions suggest these efforts will likely be unsuccessful. State and local governments with relatively lower levels of SALT cap exposure have taken little to no action. Following enactment of the TCJA, several state governments made changes to their tax codes with the potential to lower their residents' SALT cap exposure. Certain states enacted laws that provided taxpayers a credit against state taxes for charitable donations to state entities, which would then be eligible for the federal charitable deduction under Section 170 of the Internal Revenue Code. The IRS has since issued a final ruling limiting the availability of Section 170 charitable deductions in such a way that would render the new charitable activity ineligible. A legislative proposal that would overturn IRS regulations, S.J.Res. 50 , was rejected by the Senate in October 2019. Some states have tried to use a \"pass-through work around\" to reduce the SALT cap's impact on some of their taxpayers with pass-through business income. Many types of businesses that do not pay corporate income taxes (including S corporations and partnerships) pass through income to their owners, who pay taxes on that income at the individual level. The SALT cap does not limit SALT deductions associated with the carrying on of a trade or business. Hence, taxpayers whose SALT tax payments are associated with pass-through business income may not be subject to the SALT cap in the same manner as other individual income tax payments. Certain state governments have adjusted for this activity by enacting laws that levy or raise taxes on the pass-through business entity itself that are offset (holding total tax rates constant) by tax reductions or tax credits applied to individual income liability for pass-through business members subject to the tax increase . The IRS has not issued guidance on the viability of such legislation or its effect on SALT cap exposure. Several states also took legal action related to the SALT cap following enactment of the TCJA, filing suit against the U.S. government in July 2018 and challenging the cap's constitutionality. A September 2019 federal district court ruling upheld the SALT cap's constitutionality, asserting that it did not unconstitutionally penalize certain jurisdictions. Legislation introduced in the 116 th Congress would modify the SALT cap, including proposals that would (1) repeal the SALT cap entirely; (2) increase the SALT cap's value for all taxpayers; (3) increase the SALT cap's value for some taxpayers; (4) make the SALT cap permanent; and (5) repeal IRS regulations affecting SALT cap liability. Table 4 displays legislation in the 116 th Congress that would directly modify the SALT cap.",

Most notably, the TCJA established a limit, or \"SALT cap,\" on the amounts claimed as SALT deductions for tax years 2018 through 2025. The SALT cap is $10,000 for single taxpayers and married couples filing jointly and $5,000 for married taxpayers filing separately. The changes enacted in the TCJA will considerably affect SALT deduction activity in the next several years. The increased value of the standard deduction (roughly doubling from its pre-TCJA value for tax years 2018 through 2025), along with the reduced availability of SALT and other itemized deductions, are projected to significantly reduce the number of SALT deduction claims made in those years. The Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) projected that repealing that SALT cap for tax year 2019 would increase federal revenues by $77.4 billion. The SALT deduction reduces the cost of state and local government taxes to taxpayers because a portion of the taxes deducted is effectively paid for by the federal government. By reducing the deduction's value, the SALT cap therefore increases the cost to the taxpayer of state and local taxes. That may affect state and local tax and spending behavior, as any reduction in state and local revenues from increased sensitivity to SALT-eligible tax rates must be offset by reductions in outlays or increases in other revenue to maintain budget outcomes. The SALT cap's effect on the SALT deduction's value is in part a function of state and local tax policies. Nationwide, there is considerable variation in both the combined level of income and sales taxes levied by states and the property taxes and other charges levied by local governments. Differences in incomes and price levels that serve as the base for those taxes are another source of disparity in SALT cap exposure. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) data showed that in 2017, the average SALT deduction claimed in New York ($23,804) was more than four times the average in Alaska ($5,451). The SALT cap predominantly affects taxpayers with higher incomes. State and local tax payments tend to increase with income, both as a direct function of the income tax structure and because higher incomes lead to increased consumption and thus sales and property tax payments. Increased income, therefore, makes higher-income taxpayers more likely to make SALT-eligible tax payments in amounts exceeding the SALT cap value. The benefit of SALT deductions in terms of tax savings is also larger for taxpayers with higher incomes because a federal tax deduction's value is proportional to the taxpayer's marginal income tax rate. JCT projected that more than half of 2019 benefits for the SALT deduction will accrue to taxpayers with incomes exceeding $200,000. Several pieces of legislation introduced in the 116 th Congress would modify the SALT cap, including legislation that would (1) repeal the SALT cap entirely; (2) increase the SALT cap's value for all taxpayers; (3) increase the SALT cap's value for some taxpayers; (4) make the SALT cap permanent; and (5) repeal IRS regulations affecting SALT cap liability. Following enactment of the TCJA, several states proposed or passed legislation that provided possible avenues to reduce the SALT cap's effect on taxpayers without reducing their relevant state or local tax burdens. Subsequent guidance by the IRS, however, makes it unclear or unlikely that those laws will prevent taxpayers from experiencing the SALT cap's effects.",

    "document": "Speaker 4: Well, thank you. Let me just make several points, maybe two or three. I think the first point I want to make is that we have to remember that when the Slow Street program began in February, March 2020, we were into the pandemic at a time when we were very unsure about, you know, how to negotiate that. Tennis courts were closed, swimming pools were closed. Our shopping areas, you know, were very limited service. So you really weren't going out there. And a lot of us at that time, for those who are lucky, were working from home. And so we really needed to get out of the house and to walk up and down. And I remember this because Kerry and I, you know, would do that. We'd walk down Broadway and then make a left on Shoreline Drive, walk in the direction of the post office and turn around and walk back. And you needed space. To kind of facilitate that that that physical activity that you needed to get out of that isolation, being kind of cooped up at home. And so that's kind of the backdrop of, you know, where this Low Street program began. I think the idea even was before it. But I think the pandemic, as it began, really kind of accelerated it. But over that time, we have managed to negotiate the pandemic. We have managed to come back to the tennis courts. We have managed to come back to swimming. We have managed to come back to our downtown areas. We have managed to, frankly, you know, socially gather, but hopefully in a socially distant manner and with face masks. And so kind of the overarching issues that required us to put in place the the Slow Street program, I think is is not there. Clearly, you know, we've got the American virus that is coming down the pike is a significant part of the new peop of numbers of people who are, you know, getting COVID. Without a doubt, you know, the emergency hasn't lifted. But, you know, in that wonderful way that Americans are able to we've kind of figure it out and are continuing to figure out, you know, how to negotiate the difficulties. So I think the backdrop that forced us to to to adopt the Slow Streets program. I'm not seeing it there. I think even within our Macron, you know, we can still walk down certain sidewalks and streets in a in a socially distant manner. Face masking. If we you know, for example, if I'm watering my plants and I see people walking down the sidewalk, you know, they just temporarily diverge onto the street and then come back onto the sidewalk. So I think, you know, I'm seeing we're in a different condition now. That is telling me that the urgency for the Slow Streets program or the reason for the Slow Street program isn't there as as much as it was there in in February, March 2020. So that's the first point I want to make. I think the second point I want to make is what you're seeing in the Slow Street program as it's evolving and as people are seeing it. I don't think people are seeing it as a mechanism to deal with social distancing, a mechanism to deal with, you know, the COVID situation. I think what people are seeing in the Slow Streets program really is basically. A quasi cul de sac, basically. And, you know, we'd all love to live in cul de sacs where we don't have traps through traffic coming into into our neighborhoods because, hey, there's no doubt if you've got, you know, if you live in a cul de sac or maybe if you live in in the solicitor's neighborhood, you know, you're going to love what it is because you don't have traffic. And. But that's a completely different conversation, which I think. US as local elected officials and as city staff, we have to have a different level of discussion. And that difficult, different level of discussion has to come down to which streets get to get to be picked in terms of getting the the slow streets lottery in which streets don't get picked in terms of the low streets lottery because it is you know, I think it's it stands on its own that, you know, the less amount of car is going down, you know, is is a benefit. Let's not miss that. You know, we're not going to argue against that. But I think if you're going to have that kind of a lottery, you got it. We as a council or we as a city staff, we should really talk about that further. And so I think what I'm not going to support the continuation of the Slow Streets program for one more year. I think the urgency with which it brought you know, we brought it up isn't there. But what I would encourage city staff and and our commissions and our councils is to figure out a way what is the equitable approach in terms of why does one street get a slow street program and another doesn't? And, you know. For those who have a fellowship program in their areas, you know, hey, great, I'm not holding it against you, obviously. You know, you want to you want to keep it. My mom has a little series program in front of her house. And, you know, I know that she walks her dog. I remember I thought about this 25 years ago. She walks the dog, but she doesn't walk on the street. But but, you know, it gives me some semblance of assurance that at least, you know, when she's walking down Santa Clara Avenue, there's less traffic. But as policymakers, though, we need to make a tough call as to why does this street get a slow street, and why does the street not get a slow street? Why does Buena Vista Avenue not get a slow street?",

He's live today with us. Marty, what do you have, Marty? Good afternoon.</s>MARTIN SAVIDGE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Bill, we've been telling you about the 1st Battalion, 7th Marines and the job they have, which is securing the very vital supply lines, also going out to try and find, and if need be, destroy these paramilitary units, so- called death squads, according to the Pentagon, that the Iraqis have, that have been harassing their supply line and also striking at U.S. military units. What we want to show you some of how that operation is conducted, take a ride with what is referred to as CAAT Blue. CAAT means Combined Armor Anti-Tank Teams. These are basically highly mobile heavily armed Humvees, or jeeps that the military uses. They work in platoons. There are about nine of these jeeps that have all sorts of weaponry on them. And moving in on an industrial complex here. They study the maps. This area had been swept before. But today, they had to go room to room, house to house. It's risky work. It's stuff they train for, but this time, it was the real thing. Take a look as they got inside. What they're obviously checking for, is making sure that that complex was not in any way, shape or form being used by these paramilitary units, perhaps as a hiding place, somewhere they could base themselves and then strike out against the U.S. Marines and other military units that are in the area. The only thing that CAAT Team Blue found inside that complex was a number of civilians, all of them males. Now, one of the things they checked was they detained them. They are civilians, but they want to make sure that they're civilians. So they searched them carefully. They'll be looking to see if they carry any of the traditional green Iraqi I.D. cards, or any identification that would say they were part of the military. They did not find any of those things on any of those men, so they were set free. The only thing that was shot at CAAT Blue Team today was a friendly wave as they left. Bill, that's sort of how it goes on a daily basis up here for the 1st Battalion 7th Marines.</s>HEMMER: A camera shot that way, too. Thank you, Marty. Martin Savidge, South Central Iraq.",

That is planning manager Christopher Koontz and the lead staff planner.\nSpeaker 4: Allison.\nSpeaker 6: Spindler. Ruiz and Ms.. Spindler. Ruiz will be making the staff presentation for this item. Good evening, Mayor. Members of the Council. I'm here to present stats recommendation on the land use element and urban design element of the City of Long Beach General Plan. To provide a bit of context. The Council recall that the city of Long Beach is general plan as a policy document required by state law, which establishes the goals and policies that will guide future growth and development in the city through the year 2040. The general plan land use element for short has not been updated since 1989. The scenic route element is an optional element that was originally adopted in 1975 and has not been updated since that time. The urban design element, or UDC for short, is a new optional element introduced as a companion element to the L'ue. While the L'ue, it deals with the use of land. Urban design element deals with the stuff and between the public realm and is intended to replace the scenic routes element with more contemporary urban design principles that will enhance quality of life in the city and the esthetics of its neighborhoods. Our general plan Land Use Element Update began in 2004 and the Council will recall that on March six, 2018, the City Council voted a public hearing to approve the final general plan land use element, place type and height maps and directed staff to update the program air, which is what brings us back here this evening. Significant changes were made to the place type and height maps, culminating in the approval by council in March 2018. Those changes included reductions in place type intensity and or maximum height allowance compared to previous versions of the maps. These reductions took place at various locations throughout the city, particularly in East Long Beach, near the traffic circle, middle shore, Wrigley and North Long Beach. On the east side, a majority of place type changes went to more community commercial, which are commercial only, and move away from the mixed use place types in the plan. So the revised programing and updated plan text before you reflect those final maps you approved last year. And the plan text had to be updated in order to show the changes that were made to the maps, as well as issues raised in the environmental review process. What's before you also reflects the Planning Commission's recommendation in October for the project before you today? A reminder that the EU in the EU plan goals, which are listed here on the side, generally aim for Long Beach to have a more sustainable future, to improve mobility choices, expand transit access, improve air quality, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and accommodate growth projections in accordance with state law. The proposed L'union Udeh accommodates the city's population and employment projections through the horizon the year 2040, while also advancing general plan goals for open space, active living, improved urban design, sustainability and overall quality of life. The plan includes supportive policies and implement ACT implementation actions to meet those goals as well as monitoring and report back requirements built into the plan. The proposed Alawi introduces the concept of place types to replace our current approach of segregating property within the city through traditional land use designations and zoning classifications. Place types divide the city into distinct neighborhoods, allowing for greater flexibility and mix of compatible land uses within these areas to create more complete neighborhoods and sustainable development patterns. The urban design element helps ensure that the physical aspects again have more appropriate scale and massing that improve urban fabric and public places. The map change was approved by council last year. We're considered significant new information under the California Environmental Quality Act or sequel. As a result, we were required to recirculate the air, which was done this past year, and as part of the process, staff had to make technical changes to both plan text to align and ensure consistency with the MAP changes and the revised environmental analysis. Those changes are all detailed in the attachment j of your packet. Similar to the 2016 air, the revised E.R. analysis found that all impacts can be reduced to a less than significant level, with adherence to standard conditions and prescribed mitigation measures, with the exception of impacts in four areas air quality, global climate change, noise and transportation. Though map intensities were reduced, environmental impacts remained similar. The only new impact found to be significant and unavoidable relates to noise. The 2016 air did not find noise impacts to be significant, but given the timing and extent of future construction, related noise is unknown. The revised air finds us to be significant and unavoidable. But this is simply a more conservative analysis. Pursuant to secure all required environmental impacts have been considered and mitigation measures have been incorporated to reduce or minimize potential environmental effects to the maximum extent feasible. There are various requirements related to general plan consistency. This plan is designed to work for the two elements to work together and upon adoption will be consistent not only with each other, but all other elements of the general plan and with all required state regulations as shown on the slide. A much more detailed consistency analysis is provided in attachment eight of each of your packet. The recirculated draft air was circulated for public review for an extended period of 60 days between June and August 2019, including not only all legally required notification, but significant additional notification to all previous interested parties on this project. We received 17 comments on the air during the comment period. No significant changes nor new information was required in response to those comments that would have required recirculation. Leading up to the meeting tonight, we received two additional comments from the public, which were included with the city clerk and as well as a handful of inquiries and questions for clarification. Adoption of value in the EU sets a broad policy framework, but much needs to be done to implement this plan. Value contains 110 city wide implementation measures and various neighborhood strategies. The another 27 implementation strategy. Is updates to the zoning code will be a primary means of implementation, including development of new zones to implement the place types. This will be phased in geographically with deep and various types of community engagement, as we have been doing with the plan process in North Palm Beach as well as the cap. In addition to developing new zones, other updates to development standards and procedures will be made to the code. And the cap is actually a mitigation measure of the QE as well. And it will help us with many of the sustainability related policies and implementation actions included in the Louis the Council recall. We're pretty far along on the cap in drafting our framework of how to create a more sustainable and resilient city. Given that 95% of our emissions come from transportation and building sectors and Long Beach land use regulations are critical to our ability to achieve our city's climate goals, such as through creation of complete communities, to allow people to drive less, create more efficient housing and buildings, and preserve open space. But that here again is the recommendation to.\nSpeaker 7: Certify the revised program.\nSpeaker 6: Iir adapt the updated land use element to the general plan replacing the 1989 land use element. Adopt the new urban design element, repealing the scenic roots element and adopt a resolution for us to submit amendments to the general plan to the California Coastal Commission. With that. I thank you. And staff stands ready to answer any questions.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. I'm going to public comment for the making of the motion. So we have Mr. Goodhew and control carelessly. Janet And whether there's ten speakers. Larry Goodhue and Control cordless lead, Janet West and Lynnette Firenze. Sorry about that. They'll pick these line up at the podium in that order. Mr. Goodhue, your first. You're not speaking. Okay, so Ms.. Cantrell was first. Nope. Mostly.\nSpeaker 11: What?\nSpeaker 2: Go ahead, Mr. Europe.\nSpeaker 6: Okay. Well, first, I want to acknowledge the moment, because this is a huge body of work. And thousands of hours of staff time and public time were involved in that. And here we are at the point of adopting it. I will say that in terms of what was learned in this, what did we learn? We learned that people care about zoning, that they want outreach, they want to be included, and that they care about the major life investment, which is their home and their neighborhood. A lot of the work that went on was focusing on the police type maps. Not everyone was satisfied with the maps as they were approved. I know District two and District six still had issues with them, but the negotiations did occur and the product is better because of it. Personally, I learned some new vocabulary. I found out in this that I am a NIMBY and a NIMBY is not in my backyard. But in fact, I was just trying to protect the students at Milliken from increased density. The things that remain, that are still a problem. Program ideas. Negative declarations. Substituting for real year. Where we identify the potential consequences and have solutions. Things that matter. The traffic and the parking. The hazmat. Thank you. State intervention is still a problem. Thank you very much. The problem and the mobility element was control. Good evening. I have some questions about this. As I understand it, the transportation. Element of this is to build along transit lines both present and future. And I'm concerned that any place you put a bus line will allow you to build 5 to 10 story buildings . I feel this destroys the neighborhood. I still remember the cracker boxes, and I think this. Relates to what we did back in the nineties with. Over building and density and crime. I also am not sure I thought that Cecil. Area was exempt from this, but I was told today that it's been included again. Could somebody on staff. Answer the question as to whether c support is included in this l eui. Thank you.\nSpeaker 2: And it was, please come forward.\nSpeaker 6: First, it's unconscionable that you're giving us 90 seconds to speak on a plan that's going to change this city forever. The transit oriented development says that it is for metro line stations, as well as existing and future bus shuttle and other mass transit routes and stations. That is not reflected on the map. According to state law, the maps and the text have to be consistent. So you're this plan. This whole plan is not following state law. And those of you who vote for it are going to be violating state law. People still talk about the cracker box fiasco. This will be ten times worse. But people don't know who the council members were who voted for it. I'm proposing a wall of shame for everybody who votes for it. Thank you.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. Next up, Lynnette frenzy. And if we can, please have Lee Lee for coffee. Neil Rotunda man Eichner. Coleen MacDonald, please all line up in that order, please.\nSpeaker 6: Good evening. I have four changes that I hope you approve in Council District six. One is change the height from 3 to 2 stories at the northwest and northeast corners of spring and Pacific Avenue in the CC place type. This request does not need a place to change, only a height map change from 3 to 2 stories. This will allow the CC zone and Wrigley to be treated the same as other zones throughout the city, especially in Council District four and five. Number two, change the height on the east side of Pacific Avenue from 28th to Spring Street from 5 to 3 stories. This request is also not need a place to change, only a change of the height map from 5 to 3 stories. This change will be consistent with the Midtown specific plan that you approved in 2016 that allows three stories in 36 feet in the corridor district. Number three, change a height from 10 to 5 stories on the north side of PCH between Lucas and Pacific Avenue. In the toddler place type, this change will also allow consistency with a midtown specific plan. This area was two stories in 2007. Five in 2015. Not ten was proposed. Please maintain the five story height in this two block area and not allow an eight story increase in ten years. In last change, the height from 7 to 5 stories on both sides of Pacific Avenue from PCH to 19th. And change the place type on the east side of Cedar AV from PCH to 19th, from top to end. That's it. Thank you.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you very much. Next speaker, please.\nSpeaker 0: Good evening, mayor, vice mayor and council. I'm here to support Lynette Frances. Her proposal to reduce the heights in some areas of Wrigley. This is a compromise that still allows growth. She wants what we all want that future growth. Be responsible. Thank you. Vice Mayor Andrews and your staff are listening to our concerns. On a separate note, I'm hoping that you all, as council members, when you discuss this behind the rail, that there be some way to safeguard and assess new developments. That the progress we make can be evaluated in any problems be addressed so that we are maintaining the quality of life for our residents. I believe it was Councilwoman Pryce that brought it up at the last meeting, and I hope you all as a body can discuss this further. How to address problems quicker than what happened in the past, particularly in regards to was mentioned before Cracker Box Apartments. From what.\nSpeaker 6: I've read in the past news articles.\nSpeaker 0: It took that city council way too long to stop those badly planned developments from continuing. I'm hoping that this council finds a way to address these kinds of unforeseen problems. Thank you all for your time and consideration and thank you. No good time to. Yes. My name is Neil Tag. I'm a retired law professor and I'm here in support of the Wigley group that has been working very, very diligently, patiently and persistently with the city about detailed changes in the Wrigley area. I'm also channeling Linette Ferrante. She didn't get to finish number four, so I'm going to read that. Number four, change the height from 7 to 5 stories on both sides, the Pacific Avenue from PCH to 19th Street, and change the place type on the east side of Cedar Avenue from PCH, 19th Street, from transit oriented development to in founding and contemporary neighborhoods, except the first four lots north of PCH that shall remain within toddle with a 2 to 5 story limit on those matters. Now, these have been submitted in writing. They are for specific, very modest suggestions. And again, as a result.\nSpeaker 11: Of.\nSpeaker 9: A significant.\nSpeaker 0: Participation effort over years, I think I actually came here and gave a comment two years, two or three years ago, and I don't recognize half the members of the city council. But my point is, this is a long, concerted effort, an effort by members of the Wrigley neighborhood to improve the quality of life. Working very patiently and diligently with the city. I would encourage you to consider this to take into account that persistence in your consider in your detailed considerations. Thank you.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you very much. I don't.\nSpeaker 6: Good evening. Honorable mayor. Vice Mayor, council members. I'm gonna ignore. I'm a sixth district resident as Neal was saying is one that was seeing as we were saying, we've been doing this for a long time. We've been very, very diligent through these years. And I've learned a lot. And I've got a lot of I've spent a lot of time with the vice mayor and staff. I've talked to you guys a lot, and thank you all for all the help in answering all my questions. I understand that Playscape changes require new art. New e r e i ars. We are asking for a one place per type change and that's the reduction on Cedar Avenue from which was once the founding and contemporary neighborhood, the very first air that was done. And then it was changed to the seven story. And we'd like to put back because it is a single family neighborhood put back to founding and contemporary neighborhoods. And we've always been told through all the years that you can lower heights and it's a lessening of impact. So therefore it does not require a new air. And plus, we had already done an air of that the first round of the year. So please hear us as one last time and consider our requests. It's our last stand. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you.\nSpeaker 2: I'm calling McDonald.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you. Garcia Good evening. Council Members Well, I would just be regurgitating what Lee, Leonard, Mona and Neil have just said. We're asking for three height, three changes on the height map. Very small areas of Wrigley. And then the one place type change to recognize the actual nature of Cedar Avenue. So those are I'm not going to read what I brought. I just hope that that it can be achieved tonight. So thank you very much. And. Good evening.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you very much. That concludes public comment. I had. I said, you can't.\nSpeaker 10: I want to thank men. I want to thank staff for the great report and all of the hard work. This has been a laborious process, but also one that was mentioned here by in public comment, one that is also, I think shall be the passion from for many of our residents throughout the city who were involved in this process. I think there was a lot of compromise. This isn't a perfect document. I don't think the land use element before in 1980 was was perfect. I'd be interested to know what percentage. Or how much was actually realized in that land use element today from staff. Do you have any idea in terms of the planning that was was laid out in the element and how much of that was actually realized or done? So, Councilmember, I can't give you a number. I can tell you there's concepts on that plan, including the rebuilding and renaissance in downtown, that the crafters of that 1989 plan got spot on and completely came true. There's other items in that plan talking about growth in other parts of the city, sort of outside of downtown, that they completely missed the mark because they felt that there would be growth in housing and goods and services, but that that would be in these one and two story buildings that the world evolved and that didn't come to be. So it's a plan that both was very successful and what it had to say about downtown and also really missed the mark on the rest of our city. And while downtown is very important, it's 2% of a very large, diverse city with a lot of important neighborhoods and shopping districts . So we think that this this plan is more comprehensive and will achieve our goals throughout the whole city. But I think the more important difference is in this council's action last year you had specific direction. So this plan will be monitored yearly by the Planning Commission and we'll be coming back every other year to provide updates to this Council. So it will be a living document. And as we need to make adjustments, we'll make adjustments so that every community achieves their goals. Thank you. And what I think I heard is that this is an imperfect science. There's a lot of guesswork here and there are a lot of variables that that need to fall in place for for this to actually come to fruition. I'm hopeful, because I know we need to build more housing. We need to be smarter with how we we build our housing. Transit corridors are very, very important. And if we don't get it done in our general plan, Sacramento may get it done for us. And so I'd like to have as much local control as possible, and I encourage my colleagues to support this document tonight. Thank you.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. Vice Mayor Andrews.\nSpeaker 9: Yes, ma'am. Thank you. I would like to thank the staff who work with me and my constituents here in the sixth District. You know, the land use element. You know, I know that we are not necessarily making drastic changes to the map tonight, but I want to share my comments and provide instructions to the staff about how they implement the plans and the zoning in the sixth District. Based on my review and all of the information and the valuable feedback from a residents like Annette Manley and Mrs. Colleen. I have comments on four areas, but I do not want to submit this and I do want to submit this into record. When the development of oppose this is number one when a development is proposed is considered when northeast, the northwest northeast corner of Spring and Pacific Avenue. I would like the staff to apply a zoning height of two stories instead of three. This height would be approximately next to nearby residents and two stores is typical the retail commercial use number two. Similarly, when a development proposal is considered along Pacific Avenue from 28th Street to Pine Street, apply the three storey height of the five story. This stretch is adjacent to the veterans park and this approach is consistent with how small lodged and treated in the Midtown Special Plan. Number three, also along PCH, from Locust Avenue to Pacific Avenue. Let's keep a five story. Let's keep it five story height established in the mid-term special plan. Rather than the ten story, you know, content that this is provided in an important high transmission to the nearby residents, including a single family housing. And number four, lastly, when the development proposal is considered for the area north, the Pacific Coast Highway, that does not include properties with frontage on PCH on east sides of Cedar Avenue and both sides of Pacific Avenue and south of 19th Street. Apply a five story approach instead of the seven story to reflect recent community discussion and a better consistency with the surrounding Midtown Special Midtown Special Plan on Cedar. I'd rather I really want to use to be cautious and to preserve the single family type look that exists. These approaches to implement the plan will provide important esthetic benefits from the community but but will not change the map on his environmental analysis application that these comments will still bring housing we need but will do so with a good design. Staff can follow up tonight the actions and letters to my office. I will share with the community and the document of this approach. And thank you very much.\nSpeaker 2: It comes from Virunga.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Mayor. Just one question that you had on Slide 11. Bullet three, you have steps in project implementation. You have a phased update to the zoning code as the primary means for implementation. There were many there were some questions asked during the QE process about equestrian zones. In terms of leaseholder zones, how is that going to be is going to be addressed here or how is that going to be incorporated into this plan?\nSpeaker 10: Circle Council Member Thank you for the question. And we do have some equestrian property in the city and they've been involved in this process. So in the general plan, which is general in nature, because there's a citywide plan, we have this category, founding and contemporary neighborhood that has our single family areas, our duplex areas, our lowest density housing, and it provides some citywide discussion and framework and standards for those. But then in any given neighborhood, you have very specific issues or challenges or opportunities. And equestrian is one of those. And those are those issues are addressed in the more detailed zoning code. So there's existing rules for equestrian lots that exist today. And we'd be glad to work with your constituent on mapping those and making those those clearer. And then if at some point the city council, as a as the Hall of the body, wanted to revisit those or make adjustments to those, we could go through a process to do that. But that's all going to be in that implementation stage and not in this larger.\nSpeaker 0: Citywide document that we're talking about tonight. Thank you for the clarification, RuPaul.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. And just as a clarification from staff, so Vice Chair Andrews is our our staff direction, but it does not actually change the maps within the QE, to be clear.\nSpeaker 0: Mr. MODICA.\nSpeaker 12: That's correct. So the maps would stay the way they are. We fully understand kind of the content and the intent and we worked with the council members on this, on this and met with the community. So we understand the goal.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. Councilor Pearce.\nSpeaker 7: Thank you. I wanted to take a moment just to think. Staff I know that this has been many, many years of work. I know that we've had many community meetings with 300 plus people. And I think it's a sign of what great work we've done. Of the turnout tonight. And I respect everybody's opinion. Obviously, in the second district, we tried to increase density where we could. I know that our skog numbers are kind of terrifying sometimes to think about. And so seeing us increase density wherever we can, I think is really important. And just want to appreciate your guys efforts. So thank you.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. And Councilwoman Mungo.\nSpeaker 13: I want to echo those same comments. The three of you at the back table took a beating. There was a lot of misinformation out in the community, and you calmly and professionally worked hand in hand with the communities. A lot of them just getting to know you for the first time. And I think that we've come a long way as a city, and I think that that process has opened the eyes of city staff on how we can be more transparent and the better ways to hand-hold the community through a process to make sure that they're involved every step of the way. So thank you for working with us as councilmembers and being a part of that. And you guys did excellent work. I cannot tell you how impressed I was at multiple meetings when your stuff came out. Linda Multiple meetings, just so professional and so knowledgeable. So thank you.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. There's a motion and a second. Please cast your votes.\nSpeaker 6: Last. Council members.\nSpeaker 1: Motion carries.\nSpeaker 2: Action hearing, which is hearing next 21, I.",

    "document": "numerous publications have clearly defined the role of pkc as transforming oncogene in fibroblasts and epithelial cells . overexpression of pkc in nih3t3 fibroblasts and frc / tex cl d rat colonic epithelial cells was shown to increase cell proliferation , enhance anchorage - independent colony formation , and induce a highly tumorigenic in vivo phenotype with tumor incidence of 100% [ 1 , 2 ] . in addition , nih3t3 fibroblasts with pkc overexpression were invasive and displayed a polarized morphology with extended long cellular membrane protrusions . epidermis - specific pkc transgenic mice developed highly malignant and metastatic squamous cell carcinomas in response to 12-o - tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate stimulation . pkc was demonstrated to transform androgen - dependent lncap prostate cancer cells into an androgen - independent variant . moreover , transgenic mice with selective overexpression of pkc in the prostate epithelium developed prostate hyperplasia and prostate intraepithelial neoplasia . our laboratory demonstrated that inhibition of pkc in mda - mb231 cells , a highly metastatic breast cancer cell line with elevated pkc levels , was sufficient to dramatically decrease in vivo tumor growth and reduce the incidence of lung metastasis . subsequently , pkc was shown to promote an invasive and motile phenotype in hnscc through modulation of rhoa presumably through posttranslation phosphorylation . rhoa , a member of the rho gtpase family , has been implicated to be involved in the development and/or progression of numerous cancers . a recent report showed that overexpression of rhoa is sufficient to immortalize human mammary epithelial cells . moreover , mir-31 was reported to be inversely associated with metastasis through inhibition of rhoa in breast cancer patients . multivariate analysis revealed that elevated rhoa is an independent prognostic biomarker of poorer overall survival in pancreatic adenocarcinoma . high levels of rhoa correlated with venous invasion , advanced ptnm stage , and prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma [ 13 , 14 ] . increased rhoa is associated with tumor progression in ovarian carcinoma and lymph node metastasis and overall survival in bladder carcinoma [ 15 , 16 ] . similarly , rhoa was shown to be biomarker for lymph node metastasis and overall survival in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma . rhoa , rac2 , and cdc42 were found to be elevated in premalignant dysplastic and hnscc cell lines in comparison to normal keratinocytes . furthermore , based on their immunohistochemistry analyses , rhoa was suggested to be a promising biomarker of malignancy and/or aggressiveness in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ( hnscc ) . our previous work provided the initial evidence linking two proteins , pkc and rhoa , intimately involved in metastasis . pkc was shown to signal through rhoa to modulate cell invasion and motility in hnscc . in this study interestingly , an active atp - docked pkc conformation is not required for pkc to bind to rhoa indicating that the pkc-rhoa complex is assembled independently of the transient substrate - kinase interaction at the catalytic site of pkc. stoichiometric fret analysis with hek293 cells overexpressing mcherry - pkc and egfp - rhoa revealed that the pkc-rhoa complex is assembled in the cytoplasm and subsequently translocates to the cell membrane . our work revealed that pkc phosphorylates rhoa but , intriguingly , also has a kinase - independent action to function as a chaperone to traffic rhoa to the cell membrane . human pkc cdna was cloned into pentr / d - topo vector ( invitrogen , carlsbad , ca ) by pcr from a human cdna library ( clontech , mountain view , ca ) . the n - mcherry - tagged pkc was made by inserting pkc open reading frame into bglii / xbai site of mcherry - c1 vector ( clontech , mountain view , ca ) . mcherry - pkc/k437r mutant was generated using the quikchange lightning kit ( agilent technologies , inc . , the positive control plasmid mcherry - linker - egfp for stoichiometric fret analysis was made by inserting mcherry dna fragment into nhei / bglii sites and followed by eliminating the sequence between bamh1 and bglii sites within the multiple cloning site in vector egfp - c1 ( clontech ) , resulting in a 10 amino acid long in - frame linker sglkdppvat . hek293 cells were purchased from atcc ( rockville , md ) and cultured in dulbecco 's modified eagle 's medium supplemented with penicillin ( 100  units / ml ) , streptomycin ( 100  g / ml ) , and 10% fetal bovine serum .   recombinant pkc was incubated with recombinant rhoa in kinase buffer ( 24  mm tris ( ph 7.4 ) , 0.5  mm edta , 0.5  mm egta , 10  mm -mercaptoethanol , 1  g / ml leupeptin , 1  g / ml aprotinin , and 50  g / ml pmsf ) containing pkc activators , phosphatidylserine and diacylglycerol , and [ p]atp for 30 minutes at 25c . subsequently , termination buffer consisting of 7.5  m guanidine - hcl was added to stop the reaction . rhoa was phosphorylated by pkc  in vitro and then subjected to digestion by trypsin , chymotrypsin , or glu - c . following enzyme digestion the sample was acidified to 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid concentration and stored at 20c until further analyzed . the digested rhoa protein was analyzed by reverse - phase nanoscale lc - ms using a waters qtof premier mass spectrometry system . prior to analysis edta and diammonium phosphate were added to sample for a final concentration of 25  mm each , and 1125  ng of digested protein was analyzed . peptides were separated using acetonitrile / water mobile phases containing 0.1% formic acid on a waters nanoacquity uplc system employing a 300  m i d  20  mm c-18 5  m particle symmetry trap column and a 75  m i d  150  mm c-18 1.7  m beh analytical column . peptides were trapped for 15 minutes at 3  l / min followed by gradient elution using 028% acetonitrile in 40 minutes through the analytical column at 300  nl / min . esi was conducted at approximately 3.3  kv using in - house prepared spray emitters . emitters were constructed by sleeving a 7  cm piece of 20  m i d  90 od fsc into a 3  cm piece of 100  m i d  360 od fsc and gluing the junction with epoxy . the polyimide coating on the terminal end of the emitter was burned off using a microtorch , and the emitter was used with a waters nanoease esi mount . the qtof premier mass spectrometer was programmed to collect alternate scan ms data as previously described [ 19 , 20 ] . briefly , ms data collection was performed by a low collision energy acquisition of 0.8 seconds followed by a high collision energy acquisition for 0.8 seconds without quadrupole mass filtering across a 501990  m / z mass range . this was performed in an alternating fashion during a 65-minute run and termed lc - ms analysis . low collision energy acquisition records all peptide precursor mass data , while the high collision energy portion of the acquisition collected peptide fragmentation data . following the low collision energy acquisition set at 10 volts , collision energy was ramped from 10 volts to 40 volts over the 0.8 second high collision energy acquisition to accommodate peptides requiring different collision energy for fragmentation . glu - fibrinopeptide at a concentration of 200  fmol/l in 25% acetonitrile / water/0.1% formic acid was introduced as a lockspray calibrant through a second esi probe at 0.5  l / min using an auxiliary uplc pump . lockspray data was collected for 1 second every 30 seconds over a 65-minute analysis .   following an lc - ms analysis , data processing was performed using waters plgs software version 2.3 build 23 using the following parameters : low - energy threshold 100 counts , high - energy threshold 10 counts , and an intensity threshold of 1000 counts . data processing combined the signal intensity of all charge states generated from a given peptides into singly charged mh values and determined the peak apex for both low - energy precursors and all fragment ions within the vicinity of the precursor . first , the data was used to search human refseq database version 17 within plgs software using the following search parameters : peptide and fragment tolerance was automatic , the minimum fragment ion matches per peptide were 3 , the minimum fragment ions per protein were 7 , the minimum peptides matches per protein were 1 , missed cleavages were 2 , the false positive rate was 4% , and modifications allowed were acetyl n - term , carbamidomethyl - c , carbamyl n - term , and phosphorylation at sty . second , low - energy precursor mh data was copied into excel and compared to mh values calculated for predicted rhoa trypsin , chymotrypsin , or glu - c protease peptides bearing up to 4 phosphate groups . experimental mh masses that matched within 0.03  da of gpmaw calculated values were evaluated manually in plgs or masslynx protein / peptide editor software . possible phosphopeptide assignment was made when the measured mass was within 0.03 da of the calculated phosphopeptide mass and greater than 3 accurate mass product ions could be assigned to a peptide sequence . confident site - specific phosphorylation also used this criteria but further required fragment ions including phosphorylated serine or threonine amino acids . , san diego , ca ) was incubated with recombinant rhoa ( cytoskeleton , denver , co ) in pkc kinase buffer for 30 minutes at 25c . the binding reaction was immunoprecipitated using agarose - conjugated anti - pkc antibody or igg ( abcam , cambridge , ma ) at 4c with gentle agitation overnight . the suspension was centrifuged at 1,000  g for 1 minute , and the agarose beads were washed three times with ice - cold pbs and resuspended in sds sample buffer . the same procedure was performed to immunoprecipitate the binding reaction containing his - tagged pkc-kinase domain ( biobasic inc . , markham , canada ) , and rhoa except agarose - conjugated anti - his antibody ( abcam ) was used . the immunoprecipitated samples were boiled in sds sample buffer , resolved by sds - page , and transferred to immobilon membrane . the membranes were incubated with anti - rhoa ( cytoskeleton ) or anti - his ( millipore , billerica , ma ) antibodies and visualized by ecl using the fast western kit ( pierce , rockford , il ) . hek293 cells were seeded on 35  mm glass - bottomed dishes one day prior to transfection with mcherry - pkc and egfp - rhoa . fluorescence microscopy experiments were performed in the center for live - cell imaging ( clci ) at the university of michigan medical school using an olympus ix70 inverted microscope ( olympus , center valley , pa ) . experiments involving live - cell imaging employed a heated stage ( harvard apparatus , inc . , holliston , ma ) in combination with hepes - buffered medium to maintain cell viability and activity for several hours of microscopic observation . illumination was provided from a 100  w halogen lamp for phase - contrast microscopy and by an x - cite 120 metal halide light source ( exfo , mississauga , canada ) for fluorescent microscopy . the microscope was equipped with 100x ( oil immersion ; uplan fl , na = 1.30 ) , 40x ( lcplanfl , na = 0.6 ) , and 10x ( cplan , na = 0.25 ) objectives . rockingham , vt ) were used for fluorescent imaging ; in particular set number 86014v2 includes filters used for gfp ( excitation 492  nm / bp18 , emission 535  nm / bp40 ) and mcherry ( excitation 572  nm / bp23 , emission 630  nm / bp60 ) . the excitation and emission filters were mounted in a lambda 10 - 3 automatic filter wheels ( sutter instrument co. , novato , ca ) allowing rapid filter switching . images were collected using a coolsnap hq2 14-bit ccd camera ( photometrics , tucson , az ) . all devices were controlled through metamorph premier v7.7 software ( molecular devices , downingtown , pa ) . quantitative analysis of the imaging data and the preparation of presentation quality images were performed using metamorph v7.7 software . quantitative stoichiometric fret analysis of the data was performed with proprietary software created by the clci staff using matlab r2009a ( the mathworks , natick , ma ) , and this fretcalc software can be obtained from the university of michigan tech transfer . the methods and algorithms used in fret stoichiometry have been previously described [ 21 , 22 ] . our laboratory reported that pkc modulates rhoa activity in hnscc presumably through posttranslation phosphorylation . in silico prediction of phosphorylation sites identified multiple serine and threonine residues that are putative pkc phosphorylation sites on rhoa suggesting that direct phosphorylation of rhoa through pkc may be a possibility . to determine if pkc can directly phosphorylate rhoa , we performed an in vitro kinase reaction and incubated recombinant pkc with rhoa in the presence of pkc activators , phosphatidylserine and diacylglycerol , and p - atp . pro - q diamond , a phosphoprotein staining reagent , confirmed rhoa as a substrate for pkc ( figure 1(b ) ) . next , we identified the phosphorylation sites on rhoa using phosphopeptide mapping with liquid chromatography - mass spectrometry / mass spectrometry ( lc - ms / ms ) . lc - ms analysis of peptides resulting from trypsin digested rhoa showed about 83% coverage , whereas the combined data from trypsin and glu - c digested rhoa showed 100% coverage of the serine and threonine residues on rhoa . thus , it is reasonable to conclude that a comprehensive phosphopeptide map of rhoa was generated using trypsin and glu - c . our results provide the first evidence that rhoa is a direct substrate for pkc phosphorylation . there is limited , although intriguing , literature demonstrating that a kinase preassembles with its substrate prior to a kinase phosphorylation event . the preassembled kinase - substrate complex not only increases specificity but also shortens the time between kinase activation and phosphorylation of the substrate [ 23 , 24 ] . to determine if pkc preassembles with rhoa without an active atp - docked pkc conformation , recombinant pkc and rhoa were incubated in atp - free in vitro kinase buffer . as shown in figure 1(c ) , pkc was able to bind to rhoa under this condition . moreover , the kinase domain of pkc was sufficient to bind to rhoa demonstrating that the rhoa docking site is within the pkc kinase domain ( figure 1(d ) ) . these results indicate that the binding between pkc and rhoa does not require an active atp - docked pkc kinase conformation , and thus , the interaction between these two proteins is more complex than a transient substrate - kinase intermediate state . there is evidence that a preassembled kinase - substrate complex not only enhances phosphorylation specificity and efficiency but also plays a role in cellular localization . to determine if pkc mediates the localization of rhoa , hek293 cells were transfected with mcherry - pkc or egfp - rhoa or cotransfected with mcherry - pkc and egfp - rhoa . subcellular localization of pkc and rhoa was visualized in living cells using fluorescence microscopy in the presence or absence of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( pma ) . activation of pkcs with pma is associated with the translocation of pkcs to the cell membrane . as expected , pkc was translocated from the cytoplasm to the cell membrane following pma stimulation in hek293 cells overexpressing mcherry - pkc ( figure 2(a ) ) . in contrast , in hek293 cells overexpressing egfp - rhoa , rhoa remained at the cytoplasm following pma treatment . as shown in figure 2(b ) , pma treatment induced rhoa to colocalize with pkc at the cell membrane in hek293 cells transfected to overexpress mcherry - pkc and egfp - rhoa . our data showed that pkc traffics rhoa to the cell membrane following a general pkc activation signal in hek293 cells . to better define the interaction between pkc and rhoa with spatiotemporal resolution , hek293 cells overexpressing mcherry - pkc and egfp - rhoa were stimulated with pma , and images collected over a 12.5 minute time course were subjected to quantitative stoichiometric fret analysis . pma treatment induced an obvious reorganization of mcherry - pkc and egfp - rhoa in the cell from the cytoplasm to the cell membrane as evidenced by comparing the ia and i d images at 0  min and 12.5  min after pma stimulation , respectively ( figure 3 ) . furthermore , pma - treatment resulted in an overall increase in ed , a measure of the fret efficiency of the interaction between mcherry - pkc and egfp - rhoa . the initial increase and peak in ed occurred in the cytoplasm followed by an elevation of the pkc-rhoa interaction at the cell membrane for the entire time course . recruitment of rhoa and the increase in fret activity was especially robust in the actively ruffling regions of the cell ( upper and bottom right corners of the cell ) . taken together , fret analysis demonstrated that in response to pma stimulation , the pkc-rhoa complex is recruited to the cell membrane over time , and furthermore , the pkc-rhoa complex may be preassembled in the cytoplasm prior to translocation to the cell membrane . our in vitro protein binding experiments indicate that an active atp - docked pkc confirmation is not required for pkc to bind to rhoa . the kinase - inactive pkc mutant ( k437r ) contains a point mutation in the atp binding pocket to prevent atp occupancy . interestingly , pkc/k437r is localized to the cell membrane in unstimulated hek293 cells overexpressing mcherry - pkc/k437r ( figure 4(a ) ) . hek293 cells cotransfected with mcherry - pkc/k437r and egfp - rhoa showed colocalization of these two proteins at the cell membrane without pma stimulation . in support of these observations , quantitative stoichiometric fret analysis confirmed the interaction between mcherry - pkc/k437r and egfp - rhoa at the cell membrane prior to pma stimulation ( figure 4(b ) ) . the fret signal at the cell membrane did not change significantly after pma treatment indicating that the pkc/k437r - rhoa molecules at that cell compartment were already in complex with each other . these results indicate that the pkc-rhoa interaction occurs in the absence of atp and thus do not require an active catalytic site on pkc. the k437r mutation appears to alter the conformation of pkc to expose the critical amino acids required to interact with rhoa . our data confirm that cell membrane localization of rhoa is mediated independently of a pkc-rhoa phosphorylation event . regulation of rhoa activity is tightly controlled in the gdp / gtp cycle through the coordinated interactions between gtpase activating proteins ( rhogaps ) , guanine dissociation inhibitors ( rhogdis ) , and guanine nucleotide exchange factors ( rhogefs ) . rhogaps deactivate rhoa by enhancing the intrinsic gtpase activity of rhoa to hydrolyze gtp to gdp . in addition to this well - described regulatory pathway , there is evidence that posttranslational phosphorylation is an alternate mechanism used to control rhoa . protein kinase a ( pka ) was reported to phosphorylate s188 of rhoa resulting in relocalization of gtp - bound rhoa from the membrane to the cytoplasm , possibly through enhanced interaction with rhogdi . protein kinase g ( pkg ) activation was demonstrated to increase rhoa stability resulting in an increase in total rhoa protein levels . furthermore , phosphorylation of s188 on rhoa protected rhoa , particularly the gtp - bound active form , from ubiquitin / proteasome - mediated degradation . in the present study , it is interesting that three different kinases , pka , pkg , and pkc , are able to phosphorylate s188 suggesting that phosphorylation of s188 may be a nondiscriminatory mechanism to enhance rhoa stability . in addition to s188 , t127 was identified as a novel rhoa phosphorylation site suggesting that pkc may sequentially phosphorylate rhoa to fine tune rhoa levels and/or activation . ongoing efforts in our laboratory will delineate the physiological significance of t127 and s188 phosphorylation on rhoa function in hnscc .   we made the novel observation that recombinant pkc associates with recombinant rhoa in the absence of atp indicating that the pkc-rhoa complex is assembled without an active atp - docked pkc conformation . additionally , kinase - inactive pkc was sufficient to colocalize with rhoa at the cell membrane in live hek293 cells providing further evidence that the pkc-rhoa interaction is much more involved than as a transient kinase - substrate transition state . these observations is consistent with a published report demonstrating that the mitogen activated protein kinase ( mapk ) substrate complexes are often spatially separate from the kinase active site and the substrate phosphorylation site . the region of the kinase that binds to a substrate has only been identified in two cases , for c - jun aminoterminal kinase 2 ( jnk2 ) and c - terminal src kinase ( csk ) [ 29 , 30 ] . the substrate - docking sites for jnk2 and csk were identified to be within the kinase domain and in proximity , within 50 amino acids , to the catalytic loop of the kinase [ 29 , 30 ] . consistent with these results , the kinase domain of pkc is sufficient to bind to rhoa . our work showed that pkc binds to rhoa within the kinase domain and without the requirement of atp . the accepted model of pma - mediated activation of pkcs is that pma changes pkcs from a closed to an open conformation resulting in translocation of pkcs to the cell membrane . fret results showed that the initial response to pma is an increase in the molecular interaction between pkc and rhoa in the cytoplasm . this observation indicates that the active pkc conformation is required to expose the rhoa docking site and thus allow rhoa to complex with pkc. the interaction between pkc and rhoa showed an early peak at the cytoplasm and then decreased to basal levels for the remainder of the time course . in contrast , a gradual but prolonged increase in fret intensity was observed at the cell membrane , in particular the actively ruffling regions of the cell , over the entire time course . a plausible explanation is that , following a pkc activation signal , pkc and rhoa are assembled in the cytoplasm , and the resulting complex is subsequently trafficked to the cell membrane . it is important to point out that pma does not induce translocation of rhoa to the cell membrane without the presence of pkc. therefore , the recruitment of the pkc-rhoa complex to the cell membrane is completely dependent on the cellular localization of pkc in response to a stimulus .   fluorescence microscopy showed that kinase - inactive pkc is predominantly localized to the cell membrane under basal conditions . this result suggests that the pkc/k437r is in an open conformation capable to interact with chaperone proteins involved in pkc translocation . the cellular localization of rhoa is concentrated at the cell membrane in cells cotransfected with mcherry - pkc/k437r and egfp - rhoa . similarly , fret analysis showed that the interaction between pkc/k437r and rhoa is concentrated at the cell membrane rather than at the cytoplasm in unstimulated cells . furthermore , pma did not alter the extent of the molecular interaction between pkc/k437r and rhoa at the cell membrane . fret analysis with pkc/k437r confirmed our in vitro observations and showed that pkc is able to recruit rhoa to the cell membrane without a pkc-rhoa phosphorylation event . taken together , these findings support a kinase independent role of pkc as a chaperone to traffic rhoa to the cell membrane . work from our laboratory provided the initial evidence linking two proteins , pkc and rhoa , intimately involved in metastasis . the pkc-rhoa signaling module was shown to modulate cancer cell invasion and motility . however , the molecular mechanism of pkc regulation of rhoa remains to be elucidated . in this study , our results revealed that pkc has both kinase - dependent and kinase - independent functions to regulate rhoa ; pkc directly phosphorylates rhoa and , moreover , serves as a chaperone to translocate rhoa to the cell membrane .",

    "document": "duodenal ulcer perforation is still a common complication of chronic peptic ulcer disease . despite the wide spread use of anti - secretory and h. pylori eradication therapy most of the literature pertaining to the situation in the developed world , showed that the disease is largely confined to the elderly patients taking ulcerogenic medications.[15 ] the situation in the developed nations is summed up by johnson :  the surgeon s major role in the management of peptic ulcer disease will be the performance of life - saving emergency operations in the elderly unfit patient .  in contrast to the developing world , the patients are younger and have a long life - time of potentially useful activity ahead of them[18 ] as anti - secretory and anti - h . pylori eradication drugs are been freely used , we had expected an improvement in this disease condition . hence , we set out in this review to look at the prevalence , pattern of presentation , risk factors and management outcome in the study environment and we also set out to look at the management pattern if sufficient for a semi - urban area in a developing world . this review was conducted at the federal medical centre ido - ekiti , southwest nigeria . the case records of all patients with clinically established diagnosis of pdus , managed in this center from january 2004 to december 2011 were reviewed . the diagnostic protocol for every patient at presentation included : the clinical findings , abdominal ultrasound , and chest x - rays which in some cases gave further credence to the diagnosis . full blood count , urea and electrolytes , creatinine , and urinalysis results were documented . the patients were optimized for surgery with intravenous fluids , antibiotics , and urethral catheterization . clinical and intra - operative findings , treatment outcome and follow - ups were all evaluated . none of the patients had a prior diagnosis of their ulcer by an upper gastro - intestinal endoscopy ( ugie ) before presentation . although , 20 ( 66.6% ) of them had peptic ulcer symptoms with , inadequate or no medical treatment . the remainder , 10 ( 33.3% ) presented for the first time with perforation , with no prior treatment for peptic ulcer disease . the notable risk factor was the free abuse of herbal concoction ( admixture of local gin , spices , roots and bitters ) for body pains . fifteen patients took alcohol and only two took non - steroidal anti - inflammatory drugs [ table 1 ] . a good proportion of the patients 76.6% were referred to us from private health institutions , while the rest came to our center from their homes . after adequate resuscitation , all the 30 patients had emergency surgery of simple closure of their perforations , re - enforced with an omental patch and thorough peritoneal larvage . most of the 26 managed patients had a favorable outcome ; were discharged home and followed - up at the clinic for 4 - 6 weeks but later lost to follow - up . pdu is still a major complication of chronic peptic ulcer disease seen quite often in the study center , as well as other centers of the world as a frequent cause of acute abdomen . although experience from some parts of nigeria showed that gastric outlet obstruction has overtaken pdu in incidence , it is still frequently seen in many centers in nigeria , as well as many centers in the developed world.[17 ] this study has also highlighted that the perforation affected mostly the younger age group ( in their 3 -6 decade ) [ table 2 ] , which is in keeping with studies in many centers in the developing world.[111 ] much has been written about non - operative management of pdu in the western world . since the early works of croft et al . , there has been considerable interests in the non - operative management of pdus . in a randomized trial comparing surgical and non - surgical therapy , for pdu , they showed a mortality rate of 5% in each group and no difference in morbidity . , have also shown that non - operative therapy could be effective in selected patients . they showed that as much as 81% of their patients were treated conservatively , but 43% later had surgery . some writers have claimed that virtually all patients with pdu , could be managed conservatively . however , conservative management has not been accepted by many workers ; whereas , most surgeons have difficulty in understanding how a patient who has wide spread peritonitis with food debris widely distributed throughout the abdominal cavity can improve without operation . undoubtedly , there are patients with small leaks , from a perforation and with relatively mild peritoneal contamination who may be managed conservatively ; these are in a minority . we did not consider this treatment option because of the delay in presentation , 2 - 7 days as well as the socio - economic implications of long hospitalization . all patients were operated as soon as they were resuscitated and optimized for surgery . in the pre h. pylori era , in the developed world , it has been shown that only 30% of patients with pdu treated with simple closure and thorough peritoneal larvage had good long - term result . in the present era , ( h. pylori era ) , studies have shown , that operation may achieve long - term satisfactory results , only when h. pylori infections , present in 50 - 70% of patients with pdu is totally eliminated . however , all have agreed that it is sometimes difficult to determine the h. pylori status of patients having emergent operation for perforated d.u . in this study , none of the patients had an ugie done before presentation and surgery ; and in all of them , their h. pylori status was not known : although , 20 ( 66.6% ) of them were erratically treated at one time or the other for peptic ulcer disease symptoms . all patients had simple closure of their perforation with omental patch reinforcement , thorough peritoneal larvage and h. pylori eradication therapy was instituted . this is only palliative and is sufficient for the elderly patients in the developed world . patients who have suffered one perforation may suffer another one if anti - secretory drugs are not maintained ; as it were , for life . this life - long treatment is obviously not within the reach of an average patient in the developing world . in this study , most workers , from the developing world have also shown that pdu , affects mostly the younger age group.[18 ] all have attested to the fact that this group are not likely to be anti eradication drug compliant for life . the costs of these drugs , re - infection by h. pylori organisms even after the eradication and dyspeptic symptoms after surgery,[18 ] shows that this palliative surgery ( omental patch ) is obviously not appropriate for a resource poor center , vis - a - vis for the developing world ; that a shift towards the free use of definitive ulcer surgery should be the goal . dempsey summed it all ,  using the possible h. pylori infection eradication as an excuse not to do a definitive ulcer operation in any patient with perforated d - u is irrational .  therefore the various surgical options that have been proposed by workers in the field include : \n omental patch closure + highly selective vagotomyomental patch closure + bilateral truncal vagotomy ( btv)resectional surgery + truncal vagotomypyloroplasty + btv . \n dakubo et al . , writing from a west african sub - region had shown statistically that age greater than 60 years , alcohol intake and resectional surgery are key factors in predicting post - operative morbidity and mortality . it stands therefore to reason that since the majority of the patients in the study center vis - a - vis developing world are below 60 years , they stand to benefit from a curative definitive ulcer surgery . pyloroplasty ( inco - operating the perforation ) and btv is quite safe and highly recommended because of its short operative time , simplicity and easily reproducible by all , even trainee surgeons . omental patch closure + highly selective vagotomy omental patch closure + bilateral truncal vagotomy ( btv ) resectional surgery + truncal vagotomy pyloroplasty + btv . pdu disease is still a frequent cause of acute abdomen in many centers of the developing world where it affects mostly the youths . the relative high costs of triple regime therapy for h. pylori eradication , fear of re - perforation and easy loss to follow - up , call for an urgent re - appraisal of the present method of surgical treatment . therefore , a more liberal role for wide spread definitive ulcer surgery is suggested for most of our young patients .",

    "document": "A total of 43 states operated at least part of their Medicaid programs under demonstrations, as of November 2018. State demonstrations can vary in size and scope, and many are comprehensive in nature, affecting multiple aspects of a state\u2019s Medicaid program. Nationally, federal spending under demonstrations represented over 30 percent of all federal Medicaid spending in fiscal year 2016. (See app. II.) Demonstrations are typically approved by CMS for an initial 5-year period, but some states have operated portions of their Medicaid programs under a demonstration for decades. This can be achieved by a state requesting approval by CMS for one or more 3- to 5-year extensions of an existing demonstration (referred to as an extension). States often make changes to their demonstrations, either through the extension process or by requesting to amend a demonstration during the approval period (referred to as an amendment). From January 2017 through May 2018, CMS approved applications for a new demonstration, extension, amendment, or a combination of these in 23 states. (See fig. 1.) Each demonstration is governed by special terms and conditions (STCs), which reflect the agreement reached between CMS and the state, and describe the parameters of the authority granted to the state. For example, the STCs may define for what populations and services funds can be spent under the demonstration, as well as specify various state reporting requirements. The STCs also include a spending limit for the demonstration that is meant to ensure the demonstration is budget neutral to the federal government; that is, the federal government should spend no more under a state\u2019s demonstration than it would have spent without the demonstration. Requirements for new demonstrations and extensions. As required under PPACA, HHS issued regulations in 2012 to address transparency in the approval of applications for new demonstrations and extensions. The regulations include requirements for states to seek public input on their proposals prior to submitting an application to CMS, requirements for information states must include in their public notices and applications, and procedures that CMS would follow upon receiving the application. CMS reviews the submitted application to check for compliance with these regulations, before seeking additional public input through a 30-day comment period at the federal level. (See fig. 2.) The regulations also provide CMS discretion to engage in additional transparency activities on a case-by-case basis. Requirements for amendments. The 2012 regulations do not apply to states seeking to amend existing demonstrations. Instead, the transparency requirements for amendments are set by guidance HHS issued in 1994 and in the individual STCs that govern each demonstration. The requirements from the guidance and STCs include, for example, that the state seek public input prior to submitting its application and provide in its application an explanation of its process for notifying the public and a detailed description of what is being amended, including the impact on beneficiaries. CMS\u2019s regulations also include monitoring and evaluation requirements to ensure that the outcomes of demonstrations are transparent. Monitoring. States must perform periodic reviews of the implementation of their demonstrations, and the STCs typically require states to report those outcomes to CMS periodically. The regulations also require states to conduct a public forum within 6 months after the implementation date of the demonstration, and annually thereafter, to solicit public comments on the progress of the demonstration project and summarize issues raised in monitoring reports submitted to CMS. The regulations require that states submit the annual monitoring reports to CMS. Evaluation. States are required to conduct evaluations to assess whether their demonstrations are achieving the state\u2019s goals and objectives. After a demonstration is approved, states are required to submit an evaluation design to CMS for review and approval. The evaluation design must discuss the hypotheses that will be tested, the data that will be used, and other items outlined in the STCs. In the event that a state wishes to extend its demonstration, the state\u2019s extension application must include, among other things, a report presenting the evaluation\u2019s findings to date, referred to as an interim evaluation report. States are also required to submit final evaluation reports at the demonstration\u2019s end. All evaluation designs and reports are to be made public. Transparency Requirements for New Demonstrations and Extensions The transparency requirements for new Medicaid section 1115 demonstrations and extensions of existing demonstrations are established in federal regulations at 42 C.F.R. part 431, subpart G. We found that CMS has developed procedures for assessing states\u2019 applications for new demonstrations and extensions against the transparency requirements established in 2012 (see sidebar). Specifically, CMS\u2019s procedures involve reviewing incoming applications for new demonstrations or extensions against detailed checklists the agency designed to align with transparency requirements in the regulations. (CMS refers to these as completeness checks.) For example, the checklist for new demonstrations includes checks for whether the application included a description of the demonstration; any proposed changes to the benefits, delivery system, or eligibility requirements; information on the public hearing(s) and public comment process the state conducted; and a summary of the issues raised in the state public comment process. (See fig. 3.) We found that CMS completed checklist reviews for each of the 11 applications for new demonstrations or extensions that CMS approved from January 2017 through May 2018. CMS has also developed and implemented procedures for seeking public input at the federal level and making that input publicly available. This includes CMS sending email notifications to individuals who have registered on the agency\u2019s website when demonstration applications are open for public comment; posting the application on the website where the public can post comments during the 30-day comment period; and maintaining the public comments on the website, which are maintained indefinitely, according to CMS officials. We found that CMS conducted a federal comment period for all 11 of the new and extension applications in our review period. In addition to storing the federal public comments, CMS\u2019s website contains a record of key decisions and documents for each demonstration (referred to as the administrative record). The administrative record includes states\u2019 applications, as well as CMS\u2019s approvals, denials, and decisions about the completeness of applications\u2014a requirement under the 2012 regulations. CMS officials told us that they include additional documents as standard practice, though they are not required to be posted, such as a fact sheet on the demonstration and other official communication between the agency and the state, to support transparency. CMS first launched this section of its website in December 2011 with an aim to improve access to Medicaid program information, including information on demonstrations, and redesigned the website in 2013 to improve functionality. The administrative record provides a history, dating as far back as 2011, of what a state has tested, how the approach has evolved over time, and what has been learned from the approach. We identified several areas of weakness in CMS\u2019s policies or procedures for ensuring transparency in approvals of new demonstrations and extensions of existing demonstrations. These weaknesses related to the transparency of major changes made to pending applications, the transparency of changes to approved spending limits, and inconsistency in CMS\u2019s review of applications for compliance with transparency requirements for new demonstrations and extensions. CMS did not apply a consistent approach to ensuring transparency in two states that made major changes to their demonstration applications mid- review. Indiana and Kentucky submitted changes to pending applications, the first for an extension and the latter for a new demonstration that had substantial potential effects for some beneficiaries. Indiana\u2019s changes included adding new eligibility requirements for some beneficiaries, and Kentucky\u2019s changes included accelerating the effective dates of new requirements to maintain eligibility (see sidebar). CMS did not require either state to solicit public input, though both states opted to hold a public comment period on the proposed changes concurrent with CMS\u2019s review. Further, CMS reviewed Indiana\u2019s proposed changes against limited transparency requirements but did not do so for Kentucky. Indiana submitted a final version of its application summarizing public input and the state\u2019s response, while Kentucky did not. Thus, the extent to which these comments were considered at the state and federal levels was not transparent to the public. Figure 4 shows a timeline of the events surrounding Indiana\u2019s and Kentucky\u2019s requests to make changes to their pending demonstration applications. Kentucky: In July 2017, Kentucky submitted changes to its pending application for a new demonstration, including: replacing a provision for a year-long phase-in of a proposed 20-hour per week work and community engagement requirement for beneficiaries with a 3- month phase-in of the requirement; and disenrolled for 6 months for failing to timely report changes in income or other circumstances affecting eligibility. CMS approved a significant increase in the spending limit for a portion of Florida\u2019s demonstration\u2014which appeared to reflect a change in the agency\u2019s position on the allowable use of the funds\u2014without making transparent the basis for this decision. Specifically, CMS increased the spending limit for a pool of funds for payments to offset providers\u2019 uncompensated care costs by close to $1 billion in 2017 after having reduced the limit 2 years earlier. In its approval letter, CMS provided limited information on the basis for this change. CMS stated that the limit was based on the state\u2019s most recent data on uncompensated care costs, but did not disclose a significant change in its methodology for setting these limits. In unpublished correspondence to Congress, CMS indicated that the calculation of the spending limit was broadly consistent with previous policy with one significant change. Specifically, the letter indicated that whether the state had opted to expand Medicaid coverage to low-income, childless adults as provided for under PPACA would no longer factor into the limit, thus allowing CMS to include uncompensated care costs for this population in setting the limit. This change led to increasing the state\u2019s spending limit to $1.5 billion annually. (See text box.) Moreover, CMS noted plans to apply this change across all states going forward. CMS officials, however, did not indicate that they had publicly communicated this policy change to all states. In past reports, we have recommended that HHS make public the basis for demonstration approvals including the basis for elements used to set spending limits, and in 2008, we raised the issue as a matter for Congress to consider. CMS has taken a number of steps in the last several years to update and make public its policies for setting spending limits, but has not yet taken action to make public the basis of spending limits. CMS Decision to Increase Spending Limit for a Funding Pool in Florida\u2019s Medicaid Section 1115 Demonstration In letters to Florida, CMS wrote: April 14, 2015: \u201c\u2026over time, CMS has had a number of concerns about the LIP , including its lack of transparency, encouragement toward overreliance on supplemental payments, and distribution of funds based on providers\u2019 access to local revenue instead of service to Medicaid patients. Last year, CMS made clear that LIP would not continue in its current form\u2026.We will approach review of a LIP proposal from Florida based on several key principles. First, coverage rather than uncompensated care pools is the best way to secure affordable access to health care for low-income individuals, and uncompensated care pool funding should not pay for costs that would be covered in a Medicaid expansion.\u2026\u201d October 15, 2015: \u201c\u2026Pursuant to our June 23, 2015 agreement in principle, establishing the size, duration, and distribution methodology for the Low Income Pool (LIP)\u2026The total computable dollar limit in demonstration year 10 (2015-2016) will be $1 billion. In demonstration year 11 (2016-2017) the total computable dollar limit will be $607,825,452\u2026\u201d August 3, 2017: \u201cFor the extension, CMS has established an amount for the low-income pool\u2019s (LIP) uncompensated care pool to be approximately $1.5 billion annually, based on the most recent available data on hospitals\u2019 charity care costs.\u201d Finally, we observed some inconsistencies in CMS\u2019s reviews of states\u2019 applications for their compliance with the transparency requirements for new demonstrations and extensions. Expected changes in enrollment were not always included in state public notices. In two of the four applications for new demonstrations and extensions for which we conducted in-depth reviews (Florida\u2019s extension and Washington\u2019s new demonstration), estimates for the expected increase or decrease in enrollment were not included in the state\u2019s public notice documents as required. CMS officials told us that they are revising procedures to resolve such inconsistencies, including making additions to written standard operating procedures. Evaluation information was not always included in state applications. Although states seeking extensions are required to submit an interim evaluation report, Florida only included a statement in its application that it had recently executed an evaluation contract and had no findings to report. According to CMS, Florida\u2019s evaluation design was not approved until weeks before the extension application was due. Despite not having information on whether Florida\u2019s demonstration was meeting its goals, CMS officials considered the state\u2019s application complete, stating that Florida had met the intent of the regulation by providing its findings to date. In 2018, we reported that there were limitations in state evaluations of demonstrations, in part, due to how CMS sets requirements for evaluations, and we made a recommendation to improve CMS\u2019s procedures. In line with our recommendation, CMS has since developed an enhanced set of STCs that specify when evaluation reports are due, and reported in November 2018 that it is in the process of developing protocols to ensure that these requirements are consistently included in the STCs. Transparency Requirements for Amendments Applications for amendments to Medicaid section 1115 demonstrations are subject to requirements for seeking public input outlined in guidance the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) issued in 1994 and those included in the special terms and conditions governing each demonstration. CMS applies limited transparency requirements to states\u2019 applications to amend existing demonstrations, despite the fact that states may propose significant changes to demonstrations through amendments (see sidebar). CMS does not place limits on what changes can be made through amendments. From January 2017 through May 2018, CMS approved 21 amendments in 17 states, and we found that at least 17 amendment applications were pending CMS approval as of January 2019. These 17 states made a wide range of changes to their demonstrations through amendments. For example, one state amended its demonstration to cover dental services for adults with disabilities, while other amendments included such changes as requiring beneficiaries to work or participate in community engagement activities as a condition of maintaining Medicaid eligibility, as was done through amendments in Arkansas and New Hampshire during the period we reviewed. As it does with applications for new demonstrations and extensions, CMS reviews amendment applications by using a checklist, conducting a federal public comment period, and posting state demonstration documentation on the CMS website. However, the transparency requirements for amendments applied during the checklist review are more limited than the requirements for new demonstrations and extensions. (See fig. 5.) The transparency requirements for amendment applications are more limited than those for new demonstrations and extensions in the following key areas, potentially limiting CMS\u2019s ability to ensure public transparency for the approvals of amendments. No requirement to hold a state public comment process or provide CMS a summary of public input received. For amendments, states have a range of options for seeking public input and, unlike for new and extension applications, states are not required to submit a summary of the public input received on their applications and how they responded. Instead, in amendment applications, states are only required to describe the process the state used to solicit public input. Among the three amendment approvals for which we conducted an in-depth review, California did not hold a formal public comment period and did not provide CMS information on any public input it received, neither of which is required under the transparency requirements for amendments. No requirement to include expected changes in enrollment and costs. In contrast with requirements for new demonstrations and extensions, CMS does not require states to include in amendment applications the expected increase or decrease in enrollment, and the amendment applications we reviewed included limited or no information on changes to enrollment. (See text box.) CMS also does not require information on expected changes in costs for all amendments, and we found variation in the information included in amendment applications, including limited or no information on costs. No minimum requirements for information to be included in the public notice. Unlike the transparency requirements for new demonstrations and extensions, there are no requirements specifying what information states must include in their public notices for amendments. For example, Arkansas did not include in its public notice information on the changes to enrollment estimated from any of the amendment provisions. In addition to the differences in the transparency requirements for amendment applications, we identified inconsistencies in how CMS applied the transparency requirements for amendment applications across states, particularly the requirements related to describing changes to the demonstration evaluations. For amendments, as is similar to extensions, states are required to describe how the demonstration\u2019s evaluation will be revised to incorporate amendment provisions. The following are examples of the inconsistencies: CMS determined that Massachusetts\u2019s amendment application, which proposed to waive non-emergency medical transport, eliminate provisional eligibility for most populations, and cover former foster care youth, was determined to be incomplete (that is, not in compliance with the transparency requirements), partially due to the state not submitting a revised evaluation design plan. In contrast, CMS determined that Arkansas\u2019s application, which did not include a revised evaluation design plan, was complete. Arkansas noted in its application that the state planned to revise its evaluation to test two additional hypotheses. However, the added hypotheses did not address, for example, the waiver for retroactive eligibility proposed in the application. Among the 18 other demonstration amendment applications CMS approved during our review period, there was variation in the information the states included about the changes to the demonstration\u2019s evaluation hypotheses or design. For example: Iowa submitted an amendment application, which CMS determined to be in compliance with transparency requirements, to waive retroactive eligibility for all beneficiaries, and said that it was not changing the evaluation design based on the amendment provisions. In at least two other states\u2019 amendments\u2014Florida and Utah\u2014the applications, which CMS determined to be in compliance with transparency requirements, did not include any information on the changes to the evaluation due to the amendment or indicated that the state would be making changes at a later date. The potential effects of policy changes states make through amendments can be comparable to effects of new demonstrations and extensions. CMS has considered taking further steps to ensure transparency for amendments, but has not done so. Specifically, in both its response to comments in the 2012 final rule and a subsequent letter to state Medicaid directors in 2012, CMS indicated that the agency intended to evaluate the types of amendments submitted by states and issue further guidance on how the notice and comment provisions would be applied to amendments that have a significant impact. However, CMS did not issue such guidance and officials told us that they had no plans to do so. CMS officials told us that including standard requirements in demonstration STCs for submitting amendment applications helps improve the transparency of amendments. However, the standard requirements that CMS has included do not ensure that states provide information to the public or CMS on the effect of an amendment on enrollment and costs, key pieces of information for amendments that have and may continue to have a significant impact. According to federal standards for internal controls related to risk assessment, federal agencies should identify and manage risks related to achieving agency objectives. Without a policy with robust transparency requirements for amendment applications with significant impacts, there is the potential that states and CMS will fail to receive meaningful public input on the amendment and thereby lack complete understanding of the impact. As a result, CMS may not be positioned to mitigate any potential risks in the demonstrations being amended or when other states request to test similar policies in the future. CMS reviewed state descriptions of issues raised during the state public input process and the state\u2019s response as part of its application review. Applications for six of the seven approvals for which we conducted in- depth reviews summarized themes from the comments that were received and included the states\u2019 responses to these comments. State responses included laying out changes the state made to the proposal in response to the comments, clarifying certain aspects of the proposed demonstration, or providing justification for not making a change. However, the level of detail in state summaries of their responses to these comments varied considerably. For example: Washington application for new demonstration. Washington provided an extensive summary of the comments received, categorized by themes, along with the state\u2019s responses to each of them. One commenter suggested a 1-year implementation period to ensure that sufficient planning and preparations were undertaken before the new demonstration officially went into effect. The state agreed that this was \u201cessential to assure operational readiness and critical success of this demonstration,\u201d and revised its proposal to include a 9-month implementation period. Florida application to extend demonstration. In contrast to Washington, Florida\u2019s application to extend its managed care program provided a long list of state comments and nearly all were addressed with a standard response from the state that the comments were taken into consideration, but no changes to the existing STCs were being requested. These included concerns about access and choice under current pharmacy networks, and other access issues such as difficulties in obtaining referrals to specialists. Florida officials told us that they addressed stakeholder concerns through the state public comment process, which includes public forums, and that they are not necessarily required to provide any additional explanation in the state\u2019s application to CMS. Florida officials also stated that some demonstration elements stem from state legislation, which limits their ability to make changes in response to comments. According to CMS officials, historically, the agency has not requested the full set of comments that are submitted to the states. None of the states that we reviewed attached the actual comments that were received to the application\u2014only summaries\u2014though some posted them on their website or had them available upon request, according to state officials. CMS officials told us the agency has not consistently requested that states provide the actual comments received; however, in the last year and a half the agency has been making more of an effort to request the full set of comments instead of solely relying on the summaries provided in the applications. Officials said they anticipate that this will be the agency\u2019s standard practice going forward. In making demonstration decisions, CMS reviews and summarizes all input received during the federal comment period. CMS created a summary of comments received for all seven of the demonstrations we reviewed. Officials said that these summaries are used to brief CMS leadership as part of the decision-making process. We found that the level of detail in the summaries we reviewed varied, ranging from bulleted lists identifying and detailing common themes in support, opposition, or both, to a few brief sentences covering all comments. This variation often reflected the differences in the number of comments received and the significance of the concerns raised. For example: CMS received about 100 comments on Washington\u2019s application during the federal comment period that were predominantly supportive of the new demonstration, and CMS\u2019s summary was a brief overview. In contrast, CMS received thousands of comments on Kentucky\u2019s application for each of the three federal comment periods held for that new demonstration, with many opposed to or concerned with certain aspects of the application. CMS\u2019s summaries of comments received on the Kentucky application provided an overview of the issues raised, along with counts of how many fell within different themes and how many were in support, opposition, or unrelated to what was being proposed. CMS officials explained that there are unique circumstances surrounding each demonstration\u2014a comment period with many concerns raised or conflicting viewpoints will necessitate a longer and more detailed summary than one that has broad support and few, if any, areas of disagreement. We found instances where CMS approved changes to certain aspects of the demonstrations that were in line with concerns raised by the comments. Among the seven demonstrations we reviewed in-depth, CMS received comments for four demonstrations that included concerns about the state\u2019s proposal: Arkansas, Indiana, Kentucky, and Massachusetts. For Arkansas and Kentucky, CMS either approved more limited changes than what the state initially proposed or required that certain beneficiary protections be in place. Arkansas: In its amendment application, Arkansas requested a waiver of the requirement to provide retroactive eligibility, among other things. Commenters were concerned that the state\u2019s proposal to eliminate retroactive eligibility would result in gaps in coverage, adverse health outcomes, and medical debt for members. In CMS\u2019s approval, the agency acknowledged these concerns and allowed the state to reduce the period for retroactive eligibility from 90 days to 30 days but not eliminate it completely. (See fig. 6.) Kentucky: In Kentucky, some commenters were concerned about the state\u2019s proposal to implement a work and community engagement requirement as a condition of Medicaid eligibility, noting that individuals need to be healthy to work or look for a job. CMS said in its January 2018 approval that Kentucky was exempting medically frail individuals from this requirement, but CMS would also be requiring that the state add certain protections for vulnerable individuals, including maintaining a system that identifies, validates, and provides reasonable accommodations. We also found there were instances where CMS approved certain aspects of the demonstrations despite concerns raised by the comments. CMS\u2019s rationale for those decisions varied across demonstrations. For example, CMS noted in one instance that sufficient controls were planned to address the concerns raised, and in another instance noted that the potential benefits of the demonstrations outweighed the risks. The following are examples of when CMS approved aspects of states\u2019 demonstrations without changes. Arkansas: In Arkansas, some commenters were opposed to the enforcement mechanism for the state\u2019s proposal to institute a work and community engagement requirement as a condition of maintaining eligibility. The state proposed to disenroll beneficiaries who fail to fulfill these requirements for any 3 months during a calendar year and lock them out from coverage until the start of the next calendar year. CMS approved this proposal and provided an explanation of the circumstances under which it would happen, underscoring that individuals have three opportunities (each of the months they fail to fulfill the requirements) to rectify the situation or seek an exemption before they would ultimately lose coverage. CMS indicated in the approval letter to Arkansas that it believed the health benefits of community engagement outweigh the health risks with respect to those who fail to respond. Indiana: In Indiana, some commenters were opposed to the state\u2019s proposal to institute a work and community engagement requirement as a condition of maintaining eligibility. They argued, in part, that beneficiaries who are able to work are already doing so and the requirement is unnecessarily burdensome. CMS responded that employment is positively correlated with health outcomes and imposing these requirements serves the purposes of the Medicaid statute. (See fig. 7.) In an effort to improve transparency around its approvals, CMS began providing a high-level summary and response to public comments in the demonstration approval letters beginning in January 2018. Agency officials said this will be their standard practice going forward. Our review of the approval letters sent between January 1, 2018, and July 31, 2018, confirmed that CMS included a discussion of some of the issues that were raised in 10 of 11 letters. For example, the approval letters explained the decision to reduce the period of retroactive eligibility in Arkansas instead of eliminating it completely, as well as the decision to approve Indiana\u2019s proposal to implement work and community engagement requirements. However, the approval letters do not respond to every concern raised. For example, a number of commenters were concerned with a request in Arkansas\u2019s amendment application to no longer offer presumptive eligibility, but CMS did not respond to these concerns in the approval letter. CMS officials told us that the agency is striking a balance between transparency and processing applications in a timely manner. Among the four demonstration approvals for which we conducted in-depth reviews and where public comments raised concerns\u2014approvals for Arkansas, Indiana, Kentucky, and Massachusetts\u2014we observed instances where CMS added specific monitoring requirements to the STCs that aligned with these concerns and other cases where the agency did not. For example: The STCs required Arkansas to submit a monitoring plan for its work and community engagement requirement in order to monitor eligibility operations and the impact on beneficiaries reapplying for coverage after being disenrolled for noncompliance. In contrast, CMS did not require a monitoring plan for the Indiana and Kentucky demonstrations, which also included work and community engagement requirements where the public raised concerns about the effects on beneficiaries. This remains the case for Indiana; however, CMS\u2019s new approval of Kentucky\u2019s demonstration in November 2018 included additional monitoring requirements. Specifically, the November 2018 STCs required Kentucky to submit a monitoring protocol that includes measures for monitoring enrollment, disenrollment, and eligibility suspension, among other things. In other cases where public comments raised concerns about the impact of demonstrations on beneficiaries, including changes in eligibility requirements (e.g., retroactive eligibility), we did not observe specific monitoring requirements included in the STCs. Though CMS did not provide any specific examples, officials told us that they consider public input when making decisions about monitoring requirements. Officials also said they were developing monitoring metrics and tools that they plan to use consistently going forward for states implementing work and community engagement requirements. As of January 2019, officials said these materials were in draft form and under review. Regarding evaluations, the extent to which CMS considered concerns raised through public comments for the four demonstration approvals was also not always clear, including how input informed the evaluation requirements in the STCs. For example, commenters on the applications submitted by Indiana and Kentucky raised concerns about aspects of the work and community engagement requirements proposed by each state, such as the requirements for reporting work or other activities and the circumstances under which beneficiaries would lose coverage. In the STCs for Indiana, CMS did not include specific hypotheses that the state would be required to test related to its work and community engagement policies. Instead, CMS noted that the state\u2019s goals should inform the evaluation, subject to CMS approval. For example, Indiana\u2019s goals included determining whether implementing work and community engagement requirements will lead to sustainable employment and improved health outcomes among beneficiaries. In the STCs for Kentucky\u2019s initial approval in January 2018, CMS included the same language as in Indiana\u2014that the goals should inform the state\u2019s evaluation. However, in the STCs approved for Kentucky in November 2018, CMS added some broad guidance for Kentucky\u2019s draft evaluation design. Specifically, CMS included a variety of hypotheses that the state must evaluate, such as the effect of work requirements on enrollment and the impact of the demonstration on uncompensated care costs. When approving evaluation designs, the extent to which CMS considers areas of risk identified through public input is also unclear at this time. As of January 2019, evaluation designs for the Arkansas and Indiana demonstrations were under review at CMS and Kentucky had not yet submitted one. Regarding Arkansas\u2019s evaluation design, CMS sent a letter to the state providing comments and feedback that seem to align with some of the concerns raised about the demonstration through public input. Specifically, the November 2018 letter from CMS raised concerns with the state\u2019s \u201cbroadly defined\u201d expected outcomes of the demonstration, which included culture of work and personal life stability. CMS recommended that the state revise the design to include a list of quantifiable outcomes and measures that capture the important features, such as increased employment (e.g., hours worked, wages) and improved health (e.g., health care utilization). For Massachusetts, the one demonstration with an approved evaluation design, the extent to which CMS considered public input during approval was unclear. For example, with regard to Massachusetts\u2019s proposal to discontinue provisional eligibility for most adults, commenters raised concerns about the potential effects on beneficiaries\u2019 timely access to coverage and care; however, the evaluation design did not include plans to examine the effects of the policy on beneficiaries. Though CMS did not provide specific examples of how public input had informed evaluation designs, CMS officials said requirements for evaluations have been evolving as they have gained experience in understanding the public\u2019s concerns. Officials also said they were developing robust evaluation guidance that they plan to use consistently going forward for states implementing work and community engagement requirements. As of January 2019, officials said this guidance was in draft form and under review. While CMS has long recognized the importance of public input in the demonstration approval process, the agency has developed more robust procedures for ensuring transparency since the beginning of 2012. Despite this progress, CMS\u2019s approach to ensuring transparency when states propose major changes to their demonstrations has significant gaps. The lack of policies for ensuring transparency when states make major changes to pending applications and limited transparency requirements applied for amendments\u2014which are being used by some states to make major changes to their demonstrations\u2014puts CMS\u2019s goal of transparency at risk. These gaps may leave the agency and the public without key information to fully understand the potential impact of the changes being proposed, including on beneficiaries and costs. These risks take on increased importance given that CMS is encouraging states to use the flexibility provided under demonstrations to test changes to their Medicaid programs that could have significant effects for beneficiaries and other stakeholders. We are making the following two recommendations to CMS: The Administrator of CMS should develop and communicate a policy that defines when changes to a pending section 1115 demonstration application are considered major and should prompt a new review of the application against the transparency requirements applicable to the pending application. (Recommendation 1) The Administrator of CMS should develop and communicate a policy whereby applications for section 1115 demonstration amendments that may have significant impact are subject to transparency requirements comparable to those for new demonstrations and extensions. (Recommendation 2) We provided a draft of this report to HHS for review and comment. HHS concurred with both recommendations. HHS\u2019s comments are reproduced in appendix III. Regarding our first recommendation concerning when states submit major changes to pending demonstration applications, HHS stated that it will develop (1) standards for determining when such changes are so substantial that it would be appropriate for HHS to solicit additional public input, and (2) a process for informing states and the public about the additional comment period. These steps appear to formalize the approach CMS has already been taking as demonstrated by the agency\u2019s response to the changes submitted by Indiana and Kentucky to their applications. Our recommendation, however, requires additional actions. In particular, we recommended that CMS develop and communicate a policy that includes standards for when changes are substantial enough to warrant a new review of the application against the transparency requirements. The transparency requirements, among other things, call for states to provide for public notice and input at the state level before they submit their applications. As such, holding an additional federal comment period would not be sufficient to meet our concerns. Regarding our second recommendation\u2014concerning transparency requirements for amendment applications that may have significant impacts\u2014HHS said that it has implemented enhanced processes to improve transparency and will review its current processes and develop additional policies and processes, as needed, to enhance the transparency of such applications. However, the enhanced processes HHS referred to do not apply to amendments. Thus, HHS\u2019s planned review of its policies alone would not be sufficient to meet our concerns. HHS\u2019s efforts should also result in actions to develop and communicate a policy that ensures amendments with significant impacts meet transparency requirements comparable to those for other applications, namely new demonstrations and extensions.

    "human_reference": "Section 1115 demonstrations are a significant component of Medicaid spending and affect the care of millions of beneficiaries. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act required the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to establish procedures to ensure transparency in approvals of new demonstrations and extensions to existing demonstrations. The act did not address amendments, which are subject to long-standing guidance on public input. GAO was asked to examine the transparency of demonstration approvals. Among other things, this report examines CMS's transparency policies and procedures for new demonstrations and extensions, and amendments to existing demonstrations. To review a variety of approval types across a large number of states, GAO examined all approvals of new demonstrations and extensions of and amendments to existing demonstrations granted from January 2017 through May 2018. GAO also conducted in-depth reviews of one approval in each of seven states, selected to include at least two approvals of each type. GAO reviewed demonstration documentation for these states, and interviewed state and federal Medicaid officials. GAO also assessed CMS's procedures against federal internal control standards. Medicaid demonstrations allow states flexibility to test new approaches for providing coverage and delivering Medicaid services. Since 2012, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), which oversees demonstrations, has developed procedures to improve the transparency of the approval process. For example, CMS reviews demonstration applications (including for new demonstrations, extensions, and amendments to existing demonstrations) for their compliance with applicable transparency requirements, including that states seek public input on their applications. However, GAO found weaknesses in CMS's policies for ensuring transparency. Changes to pending applications for new demonstrations or extensions. CMS lacks policies for ensuring transparency when states submit major changes to pending applications. For two of the four approvals of new demonstrations or extensions GAO reviewed in-depth, states submitted changes to their applications that could have significant effects on beneficiaries (such as disenrollment or other penalties) without first obtaining public comment on these changes at the state level. Amendments to existing demonstrations. CMS's transparency requirements for amendments are limited. For example, CMS does not require amendment applications to include how the changes may affect beneficiary enrollment or report on concerns raised in state public comments. However, states have proposed major changes\u2014such as work and community engagement requirements\u2014through amendments, raising concerns that major changes to states' demonstrations are being approved without a complete understanding of their impact. CMS should develop policies for ensuring transparency when states (1) submit major changes to pending demonstration applications and (2) propose amendments to existing demonstrations. HHS concurred with these recommendations.",

    "document": "The morning after the row the night before, Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg barely exchanged a word in the first-class cabin of their Emirates flight to Dubai, en route to the next race in Bahrain. If the two Mercedes drivers are not quite on non-speaking terms, they are communicating only when they have to. While they kept quiet among themselves, both had a further say in public about the dispute that broke out after the Chinese Grand Prix. Hamilton was particularly strident saying that the difference is that he is a \u2018racer\u2019 and Rosberg is not. Lewis Hamilton (right) and Nico Rosberg have both had their say on Sunday's Chinese Grand Prix . Winner Hamilton (centre) waves to the crowd as Rosberg (left) and Sebastian Vettel shake hands . Briefly, the bones of the argument are these. Rosberg, who was beaten into second place by Hamilton, said his team-mate had been \u2018selfish\u2019 by slowing down while leading the race. It caused him (Rosberg) to be bunched up closer to the attacking Ferrari of Sebastian Vettel, whom he feared could overhaul him. Vettel did not manage to do so and finished third. The verbal spat played out at the press conference as the two protagonists sat side by side. Rosberg fumed. Hamilton smiled, seemingly happy to have riled his title rival. But it can now be revealed what happened after they finished their subsequent round of interviews in the Shanghai paddock on Sunday night. Both went through their usual engineering debriefs before being brought in one by one to meet senior Mercedes management including Toto Wolff and Paddy Lowe, team principal and technical director respectively. Hamilton went in first and was in conversation with his bosses for half an hour. Rosberg for 20 minutes, now in a room illuminated by lights as darkness crept in outside. Then, more than two hours after the race had finished, Wolff was happy the team had got their story straight enough to speak to journalists. It was now 90 minutes after his scheduled press conference. Rosberg (left) was clearly angry with Hamilton in Sunday's press conference and hit out at his team-mate . The British driver (right) denied he had done anything wrong following Rosberg's accusations . Hamilton (right) backed his corner when it was claimed that he had scuppered his team-mate's race . He declared the talks \u2018positive\u2019 and cleared both his drivers of wrongdoing. Hamilton then spoke to the press under an embargo that mean his words have not appeared until now. \u2018Nico didn\u2019t try,\u2019 he said with passion, often repeating his words for emphasis. \u2018Nico didn\u2019t try. \u2018They said maybe he was just comfortable in second place and I said, \u201cWell that\u2019s the difference between us. I want to win always.\u201d \u2018And I would have done everything to get past today. Or at least pushed for three laps. He wasn\u2019t quick enough. \u2018This is motor racing, man. Racing. Don\u2019t take away the fun of the racing. It\u2019s racing. I wouldn\u2019t have sat back two seconds to make it to the end of the stint. \u2018I don\u2019t even know what Nico\u2019s point is. Where we are is that I just won the race today. I did the best job I could possibly have done and the team got a one-two.\u2019 Hamilton\u2019s explanation for slowing down is that he was running his own race and conserving his tyres as best suited him. No neutral I have spoken to within Formula One disputes the world champion\u2019s rationale. Hamilton (centre) celebrates his win with the Mercedes team, but Rosberg (right) appears less pleased . Hamilton crosses the line to claim his second win of the season and his fourth in China . \u2018Ultimately this is Formula One,\u2019 added Hamilton. \u2018I want the guy to be up my a*** if he\u2019s got the pace to be up my a***, and putting pressure on me. And if I can\u2019t defend it, I lose, like in Bahrain last year. I wasn\u2019t quick enough and I did everything I could to stay ahead. And that was the greatest race ever.\u2019 The greatest race of this young century, certainly. Both drivers are now spending a few days in Dubai before travelling to Bahrain for this year\u2019s race on Sunday. Before leaving, and without knowing what Hamilton had said, Rosberg offered his considered version of events through his customary post-race video, on which he answered fans\u2019 questions. One asked if he was \u2018crying\u2019 \u2013 by which the questioner meant moaning or being a poor loser. Rosberg said: \u2018You say that I was crying. OK, I respect your opinion, and I\u2019ll keep it in mind and I\u2019ll try to show respect when it\u2019s due going forward.\u2019 Hamilton in front of team-mate Rosberg during Sunday's Chinese Grand Prix in Shanghai . Rosberg (right) speaks with Mercedes executive director Toto Wolff in Shanghai during the weekend . But why did he not push to pass Hamilton? \u2018It might not be so easy to understand from the outside,\u2019 said the German. \u2018But the reason is, I did try to attack Lewis in the first stint, and it just didn\u2019t work. All I did was destroy my tyres. \u2018So in the second stint there was no point to do that again. I would have completely destroyed my tyres and Vettel could have had a really good shot at overtaking me. My only chance of winning the race anyway, or to fight Lewis, or try to overtake him, would have come at the end of the race, so that\u2019s what I was building up to. \u2018The worst part of the weekend was losing out to Lewis in qualifying. That compromised me most. And it was by just four-hundredths. That\u2019s all down to me to be those five-hundredths quicker next time.\u2019",

Drogba\u00a0celebrated playing his part in Chelsea's 1-0 victory over Manchester United on Saturday night by putting on the event at London's swanky Dorchester Hotel. And the Ivory Coast icon was delighted with how the evening panned out, as his team-mates and other members of the world of football and celebrity helped raise a figure that will open a medical clinic in Abidjan, Ivory Coast's capital, later this year.

Blues Brothers Eden Hazard and Didier Drogba enjoy a boogie alongside popstar Christina Milian at the Dorchester hotel in London . Chelsea striker Drogba and pop beauty Milian enjoy a sing and a dance at the Ivorian's charity bash at the swanky Dorchester hotel in London . \u2018I\u2019m always so overwhelmed by the kind generosity and support that we see each time we host these events and Saturday was no exception,\u2019 said Drogba. Christina Milian was joined on stage by the Chelsea forward for a night of entertainment in the West End, after Jose Mourinho's side had moved one step closer to sealing their third Premier League title. The Didier Drogba Foundation has provided financial support across health and education in Africa since it was founded in 2007, and following the fourth ball to be held, many more children in villages outside of Abidjan will now receive treatment for medical conditions through mobile  clinics. Drogba was thankful to team-mates Petr Cech, Eden Hazard, Branislav Ivanovic, Gary Cahill, Juan Cuadrado, Nemanja Matic and John Terry for attending the ball, alongside many other guests which included Thierry Henry, Edgar Davids and Jermaine Defoe. Drogba cracks a smile alongside popstar Milian during the charity ball at London's swanky Dorchester hotel on Saturday night .

    "document": "Virtual reality may still seem like a hobby reserved for hardcore gamers, but as headsets drop in price it is on the verge of becoming mainstream. One firm helping to fuel this trend is Immerse. It has created a virtual reality headset that works with any Android and iOS phone and is compatible with hundreds of virtual reality apps from the respective stores. It additionally lets people watch 3D movies - all for the relatively cheap price of \u00a329.99 ($45). Scroll down for video . The Immerse virtual reality headset (pictured) is available from Firebox for \u00a329.95 ($45). It works with any Android and iOS phone that can run virtual reality apps from the respective stores, and will play any 3D movie . The maximum size of compatible devices is 3.5 x 5.7-inches (8.2 x 15.4cm), which means it will work with the iPhone 6, but not the iPhone 6 Plus, for example. However, in theory any device with a screen that fits these measurements and that can run a 3D movie or virtual reality apps will work because the processing power comes entirely from the gadget. Immerse  is fitted with an earphone slot to truly immerse the wearer in whatever they are watching and has adjustable head straps and lenses. Other features include 360\u00b0 head tracking and an 'ultra-wide field of view' - although the exact degree of view isn't listed. Immerse calls itself an affordable alternative to rivals such as Oculus Rift, which is expected to launch a consumer version 'soon' with prices ranging from between $200 (\u00a3135) and $400 (\u00a3270). Immerse is available to buy from  Firebox and can be shipped internationally.

Google also recently teamed up with Mattel to revamp the 1980s classic, the View-Master. According to Mattel, users of the device will feel like they are 'inside the scene'. It said: 'Take a virtual field trip to Paris and sit in the shadows of the Eiffel Tower as it soars above you. Visit historic Alcatraz Island and interact with your surroundings to discover fun facts. 'Travel through time and space in ways you never thought possible.' Elsewhere, Google recently funded a firm called Magic Leap that makes augmented reality glasses.

Sony's Morpheus headset (picutred) is expected to launch in 2016 but prices have not yet been announced . Michael Abrash, chief scientist from Facebook-owned virtual reality (VR) experts Oculus said at the firm's annual F8 conference in San Francisco said The Matrix provides the best sense of what virtual reality could someday be like. He said our brain never sees the real world, but instead infers it based on the 'sparse' data it receives and used a series of optical illusions to make this point. For example, he explained that humans only have three colour sensors, we can\u2019t see infrared or ultraviolet and we have a blind spot in each eye. \u2018Our visual data is actually astonishingly sparse and even if we were able to accurately record and process every photon that reaches our eyes, we\u2019d still have too little data to be able to reconstruct the world accurately,' he said. He used the recent black and blue/white and gold dress as an example. \u2018Our visual system takes its best guess and sends that to the conscious mind,\u2019 he continued. 'The way that the brain compensates for the limited data it receives is by maintaining a model of the real world that it constantly updates as new data comes in. Google offers its Google Cardboard headset (pictured) for free by downloading the folding instructions. Or users can buy pre-folded versions from designers for around $24.99 (\u00a316.75) Michael Abrash, chief scientist from Oculus recently used this image to show how vision is simply our perception of the world, but isn't realty. The pills are the same shade of grey, and the red and blue colours that people see are simply what their brains perceive, based on the rest of the information around them . 'And it is that model, not the real world, that you experience and trust implicitly. We are inference machines, not objective observers. He then showed a red and blue pill on hands that were shown on a yellow background to give an example of how this inference model breaks down. The colours of the pills are the same shade of grey, and the red and blue colours that people see are simply what their brains perceive, based on the rest of the information around them. And even when a person knows that the pills are grey, they still see them as red or blue. \u2018Your visual system isn\u2019t interested in whether the photons coming from a tile on a random image are red or blue or grey,' Mr Abrash continued. 'Knowing that didn\u2019t keep anyone from being eaten by lions on the Savannah. What it is interested in is identifying potentially relevant features, in the real world, under a variety of conditions. 'Your visual system constantly corrects for the colours in the scene. It is reverse engineering reality rather than just recording it. The colours seen are your brain\u2019s \u201cbest guess.\u201d\u2019",

cdk2 or ad - cyclin e alone ( fig . this study documents for the first time that pthrp can enhance human -cell growth and function . the major novel findings of this study are as follows : 1 ) the pthrp receptor is present in human -cells . 2 ) overexpression of pthrp causes a significant threefold increase in human -cell proliferation without negatively impacting function . 3 ) the secreted amino terminus 1 - 36 peptide of pthrp is sufficient to induce replication without causing significant dedifferentiation of human -cells . 4 ) pthrp(1 - 36 ) not only increases proliferation but simultaneously enhances human -cell function , as evidenced by a significant increase in insulin secretion at both physiological ( 5.5 mmol / l ) and pathophysiological ( 22 5 ) pthrp(1 - 36 ) specifically increases expression of the late g1/s cell cycle activators cyclin e and cdk2 at the posttranscriptional level in human islets . 7 ) more importantly , the combination of these two molecules has a substantive synergistic effect on human -cell proliferation . the current study , together with previous work ( 68,1012 ) , establishes pthrp as a factor that enhances proliferation and function in primary -cells from both rodent and human islets . whereas in some instances activation of human -cell replication may induce dedifferentiation ( 17 ) , in others  e.g . , in this study and with overexpression of cdk6/cyclin d1 or constitutively active akt ( 18,19)induction of human -cell proliferation maintains or even augments -cell function . based on studies in rodent islets ( 12 ) , it is likely that pthrp(1 - 36 ) may enhance insulin secretion in human islets through activation of the camp pathway . this mitogenic activity is associated with changes in cyclin d1 transcription , activation of cyclin e / cdk2 kinase activity , or reduction of p57 or p27 inhibitors ( 2022 ) . in human -cells , we found that pthrp(1 - 36 ) is sufficient to induce proliferation , causing an increase in expression at the posttrancriptional level of two activators of the late phase of the g1/s cell - cycle check point , cdk2 and cyclin e. pthrp regulates the stability of p27 in smooth - muscle cells , as well as the androgen receptor in prostate cancer cells , through the proteosomal degradation pathway ( 21,23 ) . cyclin e protein is also tightly regulated through proteasome - mediated degradation by the e3 ubiquitin ligases ( 24 ) . whether pthrp affects cyclin e stability through this pathway in human -cells requires further investigation . there is ample evidence that activators of the early phase of the cell cycle , cyclin ds and cdk4/cdk6 , regulate rodent -cell proliferation and can induce human -cell proliferation ( 18,25 ) . however , whether activators of the late phase of the cell cycle , cyclin e and cdk2 , are important for and can induce human -cell proliferation is not known . now , we demonstrate for the first time that cyclin e , both alone and together with cdk2 , significantly enhances human -cell proliferation , suggesting that cyclin e may be one of the limiting factors in proliferation of human -cells . understanding the regulation of , and elucidating therapeutic mechanisms to enhance , human -cell proliferation and function is critical for the long - term treatment of diabetes . this study shows that a small amino terminus peptide of pthrp is capable of enhancing both proliferation and function in human -cells in vitro . further , it identifies two cell - cycle activators as likely downstream targets of pthrp . cyclin e and cdk2 together have pronounced effects on human -cell proliferation and , therefore , have the potential to be harnessed to enhance human -cell growth ex vivo . the promise for pthrp(1 - 36 ) as a therapeutic agent for diabetes is especially attractive , given that this peptide has been shown to be both safe and effective for the treatment of osteoporosis ( 15,16 ) and that pthrp(1 - 36 ) in the 100 pmol / l range , a concentration that is likely transiently induced in humans treated with tolerable doses of pthrp(1 - 36 ) ( 15,16 ) , is sufficient to enhance human -cell proliferation in vitro . future studies will determine whether this peptide can be used either ex vivo or in vivo to improve human islet growth and function .",

    "document": "(CNN)Anthony Doerr's \"All the Light We Cannot See,\" a novel centered on the World War II bombing of St.-Malo, France, and two characters on opposite sides of the war, won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction Monday. Doerr's novel had received rave reviews upon its release last spring. \"I must blame Anthony Doerr for lost sleep, because once I started reading his new novel, 'All the Light We Cannot See,' there was no putting it down,\" wrote William T. Vollmann in The New York Times Book Review. Doerr's work was also a finalist for the National Book Award. It's his second novel and fourth work of fiction, including two short story collections. 2015 Pulitzer Prize winners in journalism named . \"Between Riverside and Crazy,\" a play by Stephen Adly Guirgis, won the Pulitzer for drama. An earlier Guirgis work, \"The Motherf***** with the Hat,\" ran on Broadway in 2011. Elizabeth Kolbert's \"The Sixth Extinction: An Unnatural History\" won the Pulitzer for general nonfiction. Kolbert, a New Yorker staff writer, tackles the idea that we're at the beginning of another mass die-off. \"As the planet warms up, and carbon dioxide acidifies the oceans, all bets are off -- except the ones hinging on mass extinctions,\" wrote Nicholas Lazard in The Guardian. Despite that prospect, he added, \"Kolbert's book is not, thankfully, as depressing as you might think. She has a good grip on her subject and uses a light touch when it is most needed.\" Other winners in arts and letters categories include \"Encounters at the Heart of the World: A History of the Mandan People\" by Elizabeth A. Fenn (history); \"The Pope and Mussolini: The Secret History of Pius XI and the Rise of Fascism in Europe\" by David I. Kertzer (biography/autobiography); \"Anthracite Fields\" by Julia Wolfe (music); and \"Digest\" by Gregory Pardlo (poetry). The Pulitzer Prizes are administered by Columbia University and are considered some of the most prestigious honors in journalism and literature.",

( b ) a preoperative midsagittal ct image demonstrating grade 1 anterolisthesis of l5 on s1 . ( c ) a preoperative sagittal ct image demonstrating foraminal stenosis at l5s1 caused by the lesion . \n ( a ) t1-weighted magnetic resonance image ( mri ) of the same lesion , which appears uniformly hypointense . ( b ) the patient underwent an l5 laminectomy for excision of the mass along with an l5 to s1 fixation and fusion . intraoperatively , the lesion was noted to consist of a pastelike material that was compressing the thecal sac and that extended ventrally out of the foramen . histologic analysis identified the lesion as a mineralized simple pseudocyst , containing mineralized proteinaceous material that did not refract plane polarized light after ethanol fixation ( fig . 4a and 4b ) . ( a ) hematoxylin and eosin  stained sections of the resection reveal dense membranous fibrous connective tissue separating spaces associated with dense calcifications as well as smaller loculated spaces filled with calcium ( 20 magnification ) . ( b ) higher magnification ( 40 ) reveals the wall of the spaces to be associated with granular calcifications and no obvious cellular lining . the patient experienced no intraoperative or postoperative complications , and her postoperative hospital course was unremarkable . by postoperative day 2 , the patient had recovered full strength in her extremities but still had some residual numbness , and she was discharged to home in stable condition on postoperative day 3 . at 2-year follow - up , the patient continued to be free of her lower extremity pain and weakness and had not experienced any subsequent postsurgical complications ( fig . 5a and 5b ) . \n ( a ) postoperative plain film ( anterior - posterior ) showing removal of the mass and placement of fixation hardware . mineralized , extradural lesions of the lumbar spine arising from the facet joint are uncommon causes of spinal pathology . the differential diagnosis consists of several uncommon disorders , including synovial osteochondromatosis,14 tumoral calcinosis,15 tumoral calcium pyrophosphate dehydrate crystal deposition disease ( pseudogout),16 and lumbar presentation of ossification of the ligamentum flavum.17 the case we present here represents another potential consideration in that differential diagnosis . completely calcified jfcs are rare , with only a handful of instances existing in the literature . almefty et al presented four patients with multiple - level , bilateral , consistently calcified thoracic spinal cysts.12 these lesions were atypical due to their number , location , and mineralization . kasliwal and deutsch presented on the case of a unilateral lumbar jfc at the l4l5 level.13 similar to our case , the patient presented with radicular symptoms in the setting of a lumbar lesion that appeared hypointense on t1- and t2-weighted mri . it should be noted that calcification of jfcs can result from treatment as well , as mtellus et al noted a case of a cyst undergoing complete calcification after intracystic steroid injection therapy.11 \n  the case presented here was remarkable not just for its mineralization but also for its size . jfcs have typically been recorded to be between 10 and 20  mm in diameter at their widest dimension on imaging.10 \n 18 the case we report here , however , measured 54  mm at its widest dimension , showing significant extension into nearby structures . moreover , although jfcs frequently extend into the spinal canal and cause compression of the thecal sac,2 the majority of the lesion in our case existed outside the spinal canal . this may explain how the cyst grew to be so large before the patient presented for evaluation . it should also be noted that our patient 's medical history included rheumatoid arthritis and scleroderma , and systemic inflammatory diseases have been associated with jfcs in the past.1 \n 19 moreover , inflammatory arthritides are known to contribute to the pathogenesis of synovial cysts outside of the spine.20 however , no studies to date have established systemic inflammation as a risk factor for jfc development , and the role of inflammatory joint disease in the pathogenesis jfcs remains unclear . many methods of treating jfcs have been described , including simple laminotomy with cystectomy and the potential addition of a laminectomy , hemilaminectomy , mesial facetectomy , or foraminotomy.3 \n 4 minimally invasive approaches with tubular retractors have also been described.19 \n 21 in terms of treatment of this patient , it was presumed that the symptoms of back pain were secondary to facet dysfunction and that the left - sided plantar flexion weakness was due to foraminal stenosis . due to the size and mineralization of the lesion , it was felt that a complete facetectomy was needed to adequately address the underlying pathology , necessitating a concurrent fusion . our case highlights the significant variation that exists in the size , location , and content of jfcs . although uncommon , jfcs should be considered in the differential diagnosis of lesions arising from the facet joint , even if they appear calcified and noncystic in nature .",
