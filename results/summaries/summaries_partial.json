          "summary": "Assisted or supported mechanical ventilation is intended to complement patient respiratory effort by synchronizing ventilatory support with patient-initiated breathing across all phases: initiation, flow, and termination of each breath. Poor synchronization, particularly during breath triggering, can result in increased muscular workload, impaired alveolar ventilation, lung overdistention, sleep disruption, and patient discomfort, often necessitating additional sedation.\n\nCarlucci and colleagues conducted a study on 69 acutely ill patients receiving non-invasive ventilation (NIV) for diverse clinical indications. Patients were categorized by obstructive or restrictive respiratory pathophysiologies, and comprehensive measurements, including esophageal pressure, were used to assess respiratory mechanics. The incidence of triggering dys-synchronies\u2014including missed, delayed, or double triggers\u2014was evaluated following initiation of NIV according to standard protocols. The study revealed that trigger dys-synchrony was prevalent, affecting 58% of patients, with missed triggers being the most common. These dys-synchronies were associated with intolerance to NIV and were similarly prevalent across different pathophysiological groups. \n\nTriggering dys-synchrony in NIV, as in invasive ventilation, can arise from suboptimal trigger sensitivity or responsiveness. Additional contributing factors may include altered ventilatory muscle activity and loading, end-expiratory lung volumes (such as intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure), efficacy of gas exchange, and central neural influences such as pain. NIV-specific factors, such as mask-related leaks and patient discomfort, can further exacerbate dys-synchrony.\n\nThe study did not address issues related to flow or cycle synchrony, both of which are also believed to impact NIV tolerance. Flow synchrony pertains to the ventilator\u2019s capacity to match flow delivery with patient muscular demand, generally better achieved by pressure-targeted modes than clinician-set flow-volume modes. Cycle synchrony concerns the alignment between mechanical and neural inspiratory times; inconsistencies can lead to increased muscle loading, excessive tidal volumes, or inappropriate cycling, further compromising patient comfort and ventilatory effectiveness.\n\nOverall, patient-ventilator interaction is multifaceted, with numerous determinants affecting success in both invasive and non-invasive ventilation. Dys-synchronies frequently result in anxiety and increased ventilatory drive, creating a cycle of worsening synchrony and patient outcomes. Recognition and management of these interactions are crucial, as unresolved dys-synchrony is linked to increased sedation needs, prolonged ventilation, and unfavorable clinical outcomes. The findings by Carlucci et al. underscore the complexity and prevalence of trigger dys-synchrony in NIV and highlight the necessity for ongoing research to optimize patient-ventilator synchrony and improve clinical results.",

The goal is for the ventilator to \u201cshare\u201d the work, not take over completely or fight against the patient.\n\nFor this to work well, the machine needs to sync up with the patient at every stage of a breath: when a breath starts, as air flows in, and when the breath ends. If it doesn\u2019t, and things get out of sync (like the machine delivers a breath before the patient tries, or keeps pushing air after the patient is done), it can really stress and tire out the patient\u2019s breathing muscles, make their breathing less effective, and basically make them uncomfortable or even anxious\u2014sometimes to the point they need extra sedatives.\n\nThere was a recent study where researchers looked at nearly 70 seriously ill patients on non-invasive ventilation (NIV) (which uses a mask, not a tube). They found that more than half the patients had problems with the ventilator syncing up with their breathing\u2014especially with \u201ctriggering,\u201d which is how the ventilator senses when the patient is trying to take a breath. When this didn\u2019t go well, patients tolerated the ventilation less, no matter what kind of lung problem they had.\n\nThe reasons for these \u201cdys-synchronies\u201d (when things get out of sync) are complicated: it could be the ventilator settings, the muscles being overworked, problems with lung volumes or gas exchange, pain, or even the discomfort and leaks from the mask itself. Plus, the study focused only on the start of breaths and didn\u2019t even get into other areas like matching the flow or properly ending the breath, which are probably also important.\n\nIn the end, the big takeaway is that patient-ventilator interactions are complicated and really important\u2014if they\u2019re off, patients can feel anxious, have trouble breathing, and end up needing more sedation, which can make everything take longer to get better.

Clinton traveled from New York to Iowa in a specially modified, armored Chevrolet van, colloquially referred to as \u201cScooby,\u201d a reference to the \u201cMystery Machine\u201d from the Scooby-Doo cartoon, and designed with enhanced security and comfort features.\n\nUpon arrival in Iowa, Clinton made several public appearances, including a coffee shop visit in Le Claire and a roundtable discussion at Kirkwood Community College in Monticello, focusing on topics such as education, student loans, and income inequality. Unlike a previous, largely unnoticed visit to a Chipotle restaurant in Ohio, Clinton was recognized by locals and engaged with residents during her Iowa stops. Her campaign events attracted significant media and public attention, including organized protests and expressions of both support and criticism.\n\nThe document references the presence of journalists, protesters with varied slogans, and campaign symbolism, noting the ongoing scrutiny of Clinton\u2019s public image and campaign strategy. Clinton\u2019s tour included orchestrated meet-and-greet opportunities with Iowa residents and students, aiming to foster a relatable and approachable persona.\n\nAdditionally, the narrative addresses broader political themes, such as the controversy surrounding donations to the Clinton Foundation and Republican critiques linking these donations to potential conflicts of interest. These themes are contextualized within the broader landscape of the 2016 presidential campaign, with brief mention of other candidates and public perceptions of government performance. The coverage concludes with observations on the media presence and local anticipation surrounding Clinton\u2019s visits, underscoring the heightened public and journalistic interest in her campaign activities.",

There\u2019s some drama too: protestors brought up stuff about donations to the Clinton Foundation and the Iraq war, so she\u2019s definitely not escaping tough questions. And, of course, the media circus is following her everywhere she goes. \n\nOverall, it\u2019s a mix of small-town Americana, presidential drama, and a whole lot of attention on that famous Scooby van.",

      "human_reference": "In September 2016, GAO reported that annual combat aircrew training requirements delineated in the Air Force's Ready Aircrew Program might not address pilot training needs, and that the Air Force did not systematically evaluate the effectiveness of its training. As a result, Congress included a provision in Section 351 of the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2017 for the Air Force to commission an independent review of its Ready Aircrew Program, report on actions it planned to take in response to any recommendations, and provide an estimate of any resources required. Section 351 also included a provision for GAO to assess the Air Force report. This report examines whether (1) the independent review conducted by the RAND Corporation addressed statutory requirements to review and assess the Ready Aircrew Program, and (2) the Air Force has reported on completed or planned actions to implement the RAND report recommendations. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed the RAND and Air Force reports on the Ready Aircrew Program, assessed the study against generally accepted research standards, and interviewed officials at RAND, Air Force Headquarters, and the Air Combat Command. A July 2018 RAND report\u2014commissioned by the Air Force\u2014addressed the statutory requirements of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2017 to review and assess the Air Force's Ready Aircrew Program and make recommendations for ways to improve it. The Ready Aircrew Program establishes minimum annual training requirements for combat aircrew. RAND's report, entitled Independent Review and Assessment of the Air Force Ready Aircrew Program , made nine recommendations to improve its management: 1. Leverage internal expertise to implement measures for proficiency. 2. Invest resources to design data collection and storage solutions that facilitate analysis and readiness reporting. 3. Document the Ready Aircrew Program Tasking Memorandum development process in Air Force instruction supplements and ensure that the process incorporates squadron-level input and feedback. 4. Establish a more explicit and formal link between proficiency and Ready Aircrew Program requirements. 5. Document training quality to support requests for training resources. 6. Identify the conditions under which Ready Aircrew Program requirements, including mission types, can be accomplished. 7. Consider changing how Ready Aircrew Program requirements affect the Flying Hour Program. 8. Invest in data systems to correct data collection and assess deficiencies. 9. Leverage the Air Force Research Laboratory's performance data work and invest in added analysis to produce enterprise-wide proficiency metrics. The nine RAND recommendations aligned with two GAO recommendations made in 2016 to comprehensively assess the assumptions underlying the annual aircrew training requirements and develop a process to collect data to assess the effectiveness of the training. The Air Force's August 2018 one-page report to Congress included three broad actions in response to RAND's recommendations. The Air Force planned to build training matrices to help commanders assess their units' effectiveness, establish common data architecture through the Air Force's Chief Data Officer\u2013led effort, and evaluate aspects of the Ready Aircrew Program to increase lethality and improve readiness as the Air Force shifts to executing the mandates of the 2018 National Defense Strategy. The Air Force, however, did not explain how these three efforts would specifically address the nine recommendations. Air Force officials said that, though they generally agreed with RAND's recommendations, the Air Force lacked the resources to fully implement them beyond actions that were underway prior to the RAND report, and considers all recommendations as \u201cclosed.\u201d In part due to its not fully implementing RAND's recommendations, the Air Force has not fully addressed GAO's two recommendations. Fully implementing GAO's recommendations would better position the Air Force to ensure its aircrews receive effective training to achieve a range of missions. GAO is not making any new recommendations in this report but restates the need to fully implement GAO's two 2016 recommendations. In comments on a draft of this report, DOD did not concur with the two 2016 recommendations. GAO maintains that the Air Force should implement both recommendations. recommendation. GAO will consider these in its annual recommendations follow-up.",

          "summary": "Sure! Here\u2019s a friendly, conversational summary of the document:\n\nSo, the process for training Air Force pilots is pretty involved. First, everyone goes through some basic flight assessments, and depending on whether they\u2019re aiming to fly regular planes or drones, they start out with initial flight training. If they pass, those wanting to fly traditional aircraft move on to more advanced programs, where they eventually get matched with a specific type of plane, like a fighter jet or a tanker.\n\nOnce they\u2019re assigned to an aircraft, pilots go through three main stages of training:\n\n1. **Initial Qualification Training**\u2014This gets them up to speed on flying their specific aircraft.\n2. **Mission Qualification Training**\u2014Here, they learn all the skills needed for the specific missions their unit does.\n3. **Continuation Training**\u2014Ongoing practice to keep their skills sharp and, in some cases, qualify for advanced roles.\n\nThere\u2019s something called the Ready Aircrew Program which sets out how many real and simulated missions pilots need to fly each year to stay \u201cmission ready,\u201d both for their main job and any secondary duties. Air Combat Command and other branches help set the annual training requirements for every unit.\n\nA RAND report reviewed this whole system, as required by Congress, and made some recommendations to make it better. Basically, the report found that the Air Force hasn\u2019t updated the basic assumptions behind their training requirements in a while\u2014meaning the training might not be fully aligned with today\u2019s threats and missions. The RAND team suggested reassessing training assumptions and collecting better data to measure training effectiveness.\n\nThe Air Force agreed in principle with RAND\u2019s ideas, saying they were working on better data systems and training matrices, but didn\u2019t provide much detail about how they\u2019d put RAND\u2019s nine recommendations into practice. Later, they clarified that while they agree with RAND, they don\u2019t really have the resources to fully implement the suggestions. So, officially, the Air Force said the recommendations are \u201cclosed\u201d and doesn\u2019t plan to revisit them.\n\nIn short: The Air Force has a structured, multi-phase training program for pilots, but experts are concerned it\u2019s a bit outdated and that the Air Force hasn\u2019t fully acted on recommendations to modernize it\u2014mostly due to limited resources and no concrete implementation plan.",

This amount was lower than the original projections of up to $41 million, thanks in part to less severe revenue losses, outperforming revenue sources like cannabis taxes, and expenditure controls such as a mid-year hiring freeze and suspended projects. Emergency reserves and operating reserves were tapped, leaving reserves below recommended levels, emphasizing the need for future replenishment\u2014possibly with federal stimulus funds like the American Rescue Plan. Other specialized funds, particularly those reliant on tourism and events, also suffered losses and will need careful management in the next fiscal year. Meanwhile, the city\u2019s measure-specific fund ended with a $5.3 million surplus due to savings and revenue, which is now proposed for immediate infrastructure needs such as street repairs, sidewalk improvements, and security upgrades.

          "summary": "**Summary:**\n\nThe document provides a summary of the City Council\u2019s discussion regarding the fiscal year 2020 (FY20) year-end budget performance report and associated financial recommendations. The report, delivered by city financial management staff, outlines the substantial challenges faced by the city during FY20 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, heightened awareness of systemic racism, and significant economic disruption. These factors shifted city priorities and negatively impacted overall fiscal strength.\n\nThe FY20 budget had been adopted prior to the completion of labor contract negotiations and did not anticipate approximately $10\u201312 million in related additional costs; these unfunded costs were expected to be covered by previously strong revenues. However, the onset of the pandemic led to major revenue losses, and initial projections suggested a general fund shortfall of $25\u201341 million. Ultimately, the actual shortfall for the general fund was $19.7 million, with ongoing accounting adjustments possibly reducing this amount by $2\u20133 million, though the deficit remained significantly large.\n\nMitigation measures implemented during the year included a mid-year department savings target, a hiring freeze, suspension of selected projects, and utilization of federal and state grants (e.g., FEMA and CARES Act) to address pandemic-related expenditures. Despite these actions, revenues were insufficient to cover final costs, which included unforeseen expenses such as responses to civil unrest and contractual obligations. To meet this deficit, the city used $12.6 million of its $13.5 million operating reserves and $6.8 million of its $46 million emergency reserve, reducing both below recommended minimum levels. The necessity of replenishing these reserves and bolstering future fiscal resilience was underscored as a priority for any forthcoming surpluses or federal aid.\n\nSeveral city funds\u2014such as the Tidelands Operating Fund, Special Advertising and Promotions Fund, Insurance Fund, Civic Center Fund, and Towing Fund\u2014were similarly affected by the pandemic and other pre-existing challenges and are expected to require continued monitoring and possible adjustments in fiscal year 2021 (FY21).\n\nOne positive outcome was reported in the city\u2019s Measure Program Fund, which recorded a $5.3 million surplus due to higher-than-expected revenue and expenditure savings. It was proposed that these surplus funds be allocated to critical infrastructure projects, such as street and sidewalk improvements, ADA compliance, tree trimming, and security upgrades, with allocation subject to further council and advisory committee review.\n\nMembers of the City Council acknowledged the improved financial position relative to initial projections, reiterated the appropriate use of emergency reserves in a crisis context, and noted the anticipated positive impact of the forthcoming federal American Rescue Plan on the city\u2019s finances, particularly in terms of replenishing depleted reserves.\n\nOverall, the report emphasizes the need for fiscal prudence, continued monitoring of vulnerable funds, timely allocation of limited resources to essential services and infrastructure, and preparation for the receipt and proper expenditure of potential federal relief.",

Here\u2019s a quick summary, as if I were chatting with a friend:\n\nSo, the city council had a meeting to go over last year\u2019s budget, and let\u2019s just say, it was a wild year for their finances\u2014mostly thanks to COVID, but also the protests and economic fallout. They started the year hoping they'd have strong revenues, but the pandemic killed those hopes. At first, they thought they\u2019d be short as much as $41 million, but in the end, the deficit was just under $20 million, which, all things considered, wasn\u2019t as bad as feared.\n\nThey managed to soften the blow with a combination of last-minute savings, a hiring freeze, help from federal grants, and some surprising income from things like cannabis taxes and the gas fund. The city also put off certain projects and got a boost from federal relief programs like CARES and FEMA. Even so, they still had to dip into their financial reserves\u2014essentially draining the \u201crainy day\u201d fund and starting in on their emergency backup savings.\n\nOn the upside, some programs, especially one funded by a local sales tax measure, actually came out with a surplus, partly because they delayed things like the police academy. So, the city plans to use that extra cash on urgent projects\u2014stuff like fixing roads, sidewalks, and security cameras.\n\nFinally, the mayor and council said it\u2019s good news the numbers weren\u2019t as bad as feared, and reminded everyone that it\u2019s appropriate to use emergency savings for an emergency. They\u2019re hopeful because more federal relief is coming soon (the American Rescue Plan), and once they know the details, they\u2019ll figure out how to rebuild their savings and address any lingering issues from the past year\u2019s financial mess. \n\nBasically, things were rough, but not as rough as they could have been, and with a combination of good management and outside help, the city is staying afloat\u2014and has a plan to recover.",

Cardinal Roger Mahony publicly apologized and emphasized new measures to prevent future abuse, while victims, represented by groups like SNAP, stressed that no amount of money could restore their lost childhoods.

This represents the largest settlement to date in the Catholic Church sexual abuse scandal in the United States, surpassing previous settlements such as the $157 million paid by the Archdiocese of Boston.

First, there\u2019s this massive settlement from the Catholic Church in Los Angeles\u2014$660 million is being paid out to over 500 people who were abused by priests. It\u2019s actually the biggest settlement ever for the Church, and works out to about $1.3 million per person, though it depends on the severity of their experience. The thing is, even though it\u2019s a lot of money, both church officials and survivors are pretty somber because money can\u2019t undo the trauma or restore lost trust and innocence. The Cardinal in charge, Roger Mahony, apologized again and said the Church is changing how it screens priests now, but victims feel the settlement was more about avoiding embarrassing trials than real accountability.\n\nThen, they switched topics to a fire happening at a strip mall in Alhambra, just north of LA. Not many details yet, but part of the building collapsed and businesses nearby had to evacuate, with firefighters still working the scene.\n\nAfter that, the focus turned to a case in Georgia where Troy Davis, who\u2019s on death row for killing a police officer in 1989, is about to be executed. His sister and supporters are fighting hard to save him because his conviction was mostly based on eyewitness accounts\u2014no physical evidence, no murder weapon. Now, years later, a bunch of witnesses have changed their stories, some saying they felt pressured by the police. His lawyers claim this could be a case of mistaken identity. Despite all this, law enforcement is standing by the conviction, and his appeals have pretty much run out. His only hope now is clemency from the parole board.\n\nSo, in short: huge church settlement for abuse victims in LA, a breaking fire in California, and an urgent death penalty case in Georgia that\u2019s raising a ton of questions about our justice system.",

      "human_reference": "A supply of enriched uranium is crucial to support the nation's nuclear weapons stockpile and the U.S. Navy, but the infrastructure of several U.S. uranium-processing facilities is outdated. In 2014, NNSA began plans to meet the nation's uranium needs by redirecting processing capabilities to the UPF and to other existing buildings NNSA plans to upgrade at Y-12 in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013, as amended, includes a provision for GAO to periodically review the UPF. Also, a Senate report accompanying the National Defense Authorization Act bill for fiscal year 2012 provides for GAO to review the independent cost estimates for the UPF. This report, which is GAO's sixth on the UPF, examines (1) the status of the UPF project and plans for starting UPF operations; (2) the extent to which NNSA has followed requirements to obtain independent cost estimates for the UPF, and how NNSA has used information from those estimates; and (3) the extent to which NNSA has made progress in developing uranium program management information since GAO's September 2017 report. GAO reviewed project and program documents on planning, schedule, cost, and implementation, and interviewed program officials. National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) documents and officials reported that the new Uranium Processing Facility (UPF) is on schedule and within budget. As of December 2019, three of the seven UPF subprojects were complete, and four were ongoing. NNSA officials told GAO they estimate that construction of the UPF will be complete in 2022 and that they expect to meet NNSA's goal of completing the UPF project for $6.5 billion by the end of 2025. As required, NNSA and its contractor developed a plan for starting operations at the UPF, which officials stated will likely occur in 2026. According to NNSA's plan, attaining full UPF operational capability will be the final step to enable NNSA to stop certain operations in Building 9212\u2014the oldest building with the highest nuclear safety risk at the Y-12 National Security Complex (Y-12)\u2014and turn it over to the Department of Energy (DOE) for final disposition by 2035. In managing the UPF project, NNSA obtained independent cost estimates for the four largest UPF subprojects whose total estimated costs exceeded $100 million. Such estimates are required by DOE policy and to satisfy limitations in appropriations laws. Moreover, based on its review of NNSA documents, GAO found NNSA used those estimates to help inform the UPF's approved cost and schedule baseline estimates. NNSA officials stated that they used information from the independent cost estimate and other sources to help negotiate remaining work with the contractor and finalize the overall UPF's baseline estimates before starting construction. Since GAO last reported on NNSA's broader uranium program in September 2017, NNSA identified and made progress in implementing the uranium program's scope of work that includes capabilities and other activities that are not part of the UPF project but are needed for weapons program. Specifically, NNSA made progress in the following areas: 1. developing process technologies that are expected to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of certain uranium processing capabilities; 2. investing in infrastructure to extend the operational lives of older uranium facilities; and 3. reducing the amount of uranium stored and used in these older uranium facilities. NNSA has also made progress in implementing GAO's 2017 recommendation to develop key management information for the uranium program. Specifically, NNSA developed an integrated master schedule covering the scope of work for the program through fiscal year 2035 and a life-cycle cost estimate that includes program costs through fiscal year 2026. NNSA estimated that, in addition to completing the UPF project for $6.5 billion, the uranium program will spend over $850 million from fiscal years 2016 through 2026 to support modernizing other needed uranium processing capabilities and transitioning out of Building 9212.",

The NNSA relies primarily on management and operating contractors to oversee daily operations across eight key sites, collectively known as the nuclear security enterprise. Central among these is the Y-12 National Security Complex in Tennessee, which undertakes the processing and storage of enriched uranium, supports naval reactors, and develops technologies for the production of uranium-related components for nuclear weaponry.\n\nNNSA assessments have identified critical deficiencies in Y-12\u2019s enriched uranium operations, including inefficient workflows, escalating maintenance and operational costs due to antiquated infrastructure, and hazardous processes that pose significant risks of radiological exposure to workers. In response, the NNSA initiated plans to modernize Y-12 by replacing aged infrastructure and relocating essential processing equipment, thereby ensuring continuity in uranium production.\n\nIn 2004, the NNSA proposed the construction of a Uranium Processing Facility (UPF) to consolidate uranium processing functions, reduce facility size, lower operating costs through modernized equipment, and enhance safety standards. Initial cost estimates for the UPF ranged from $1.4 billion to $3.5 billion but escalated dramatically to a range of $4.2 billion to $6.5 billion by 2012, and an external review in 2013 suggested costs could reach $11 billion. Due to escalating costs and schedule concerns, the NNSA redefined its approach in 2014, prioritizing completion of a re-scoped UPF within the established cost ceiling and gradually phasing out reliance on Building 9212, a facility dating to 1945 with significant nuclear safety risks.\n\nThe revised strategy entails a four-phase exit from Building 9212, focusing on inventory reduction, system isolation, capability relocation, and eventual decontamination and decommissioning. Notably, uranium purification and metal processing operations will be transitioned to Building 9215, and analytical chemistry capabilities will be housed in Building 9995; both buildings will receive targeted infrastructure upgrades to extend operational reliability through the 2040s. Similarly, Building 9204-2E will undergo investments to support ongoing uranium component assembly and disassembly functions. The Highly Enriched Uranium Materials Facility (HEUMF), constructed to modern safety standards and operational since 2010, will continue as the principal storage site for enriched uranium.\n\nUnder the revised plan, the UPF will be a smaller facility, housing core functions such as casting, oxide production, and salvage and accountability processes, with construction subdivided into seven major subprojects, all to be completed by the end of 2025 at a cost not to exceed $6.5 billion. These subprojects include site preparation, infrastructure development, construction of utilities and support facilities, and relocation of processing capabilities from aging buildings to the new or upgraded facilities.\n\nIn summary, NNSA\u2019s approach to modernizing enriched uranium operations at Y-12 reflects an adaptive management response to cost, safety, and operational challenges, emphasizing phased facility upgrades and consolidation to ensure mission continuity, risk reduction, and alignment with modern nuclear safety requirements.",

The big job at Y-12 is dealing with enriched uranium\u2014processing it, storing it, and making the components used in nuclear weapons and subs.\n\nHere\u2019s the problem: A lot of Y-12\u2019s equipment and buildings are really, really old\u2014some going back to the 1940s and 50s! That means they\u2019re expensive to maintain, not very efficient, and pose some safety risks because the designs are outdated compared to modern nuclear safety standards.\n\nThe NNSA realized it needed to upgrade all this, so it planned to build a new, modern facility\u2014something called the Uranium Processing Facility (UPF). Early cost estimates were about $1.4 to $3.5 billion, but as the scope grew and they ran into more issues, the price ballooned\u2014all the way up to $11 billion at one point! So, in 2014, to keep things more realistic, they decided to scale the project down: Instead of doing everything in one huge new building, they'd focus on building a smaller facility and upgrade existing buildings at Y-12 to spread out the work.\n\nFor example, there\u2019s Building 9212, a massive and ancient structure from 1945, which has a lot of nuclear safety risks. NNSA\u2019s working on a phased plan to move operations out of there\u2014cleaning out inventory, moving activities to safer buildings, and eventually shutting it down by around 2035.\n\nThey\u2019re also upgrading other old buildings\u2014like Buildings 9215 and 9995 (for uranium machining and analytical chemistry respectively), and 9204-2E (for assembling uranium components). The only building up to modern standards is the Highly Enriched Uranium Materials Facility, which just stores uranium.\n\nThe revised plan is to build a smaller, $6.5 billion UPF by 2025 and make targeted upgrades elsewhere. This strategy will keep uranium work safe and reliable, but also more efficient and less costly in the long run. Basically, it\u2019s about modernizing America\u2019s uranium operations without breaking the bank, while boosting safety for workers and the environment.",

The longer you waited, the \u201ccooler\u201d the color (like purple was for waiting nearly till the end, and red required serious willpower to wait until just 0-11 seconds were left).\n\nThis became an obsession for many. People debated when to click, some watched endlessly hoping to see what would happen if the clock reached zero, and the mystery started driving everyone a bit nuts. Nobody could find out what happened at zero, though, because with hundreds of thousands participating and thousands watching at any time, someone always caved and pressed it.\n\nEven if people didn\u2019t click, they still got a \u201cnon-presser\u201d grey badge.

Here\u2019s a friendly, conversational summary:\n\nSo, Charlize Theron, the actress who\u2019s originally from South Africa, came on a talk show to discuss the HIV/AIDS crisis in her home country. South Africa has the highest number of people living with HIV\u2014about 7 million! Charlize explained that this epidemic has always been a huge part of life there, and growing up, she saw a lot of pain and misunderstandings about the disease. It really stuck with her, and once she became aware of just how preventable HIV is, she felt compelled to do something about it, which is why she started her foundation.\n\nShe talked about how important it is to help young people in South Africa, not just by treating them if they're infected, but by empowering and protecting them so they don\u2019t get HIV in the first place. Despite having the biggest HIV treatment program in the world, more than half the people living with the virus in South Africa aren\u2019t actually receiving treatment yet.\n\nCharlize also pointed out that while the South African government is doing its best, the costs are overwhelming and they can\u2019t do it alone\u2014they need international help. But she says there\u2019s a misconception that countries like the US give a lot of money to South Africa for AIDS, when in reality, it\u2019s less than 1% of the US budget, and it\u2019s getting cut even more. She worries that if the world doesn\u2019t step up, HIV could become a global threat all over again.\n\nShe wasn\u2019t afraid to get real about tough subjects like racism, either. Charlize said that, unfortunately, the world still tends to value some lives more than others, and that attitude has let epidemics like AIDS go on unchecked in places like Africa way longer than they should have. She also mentioned seeing racism play out in the US, comparing those issues to the struggles she\u2019s seen growing up in South Africa.\n\nSo, bottom line: Charlize is using her platform to fight HIV/AIDS in South Africa, especially by focusing on young people, and she\u2019s calling for more global support and a shift in how we value human life\u2014no matter where someone is born.",

      "human_reference": "In 2018, about 6,300 pedestrians\u201417 per day\u2014died in collisions with motor vehicles in the United States, up from about 4,400 in 2008. Many factors influence pedestrian fatalities, including driver and pedestrian behavior. Vehicle characteristics are also a factor. NHTSA tests and rates new vehicles for safety and reports the results to the public through its NCAP. Currently, pedestrian safety tests are not included in NCAP. This report examines: (1) what is known about the relationship between vehicle characteristics and pedestrian fatalities and injuries, (2) approaches automakers have taken to address pedestrian safety, and (3) actions NHTSA has taken to assess whether pedestrian safety tests should be included in NCAP. GAO analyzed data on pedestrian fatalities and injuries from 2008 through 2018 (the most recent available data); reviewed NHTSA reports; and interviewed NHTSA officials. GAO also obtained information about pedestrian safety features from 13 automakers that represented about 70 percent of new vehicle sales in the United States in 2018, and compared NHTSA's actions with leading program management practices. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) data show that certain vehicle characteristics related to age, body type, and the speed of the vehicle at the time of the crash are associated with increases in pedestrian fatalities from 2008 to 2018. Specifically, the number of pedestrian fatalities during this time period increased more for crashes involving vehicles that were: 11 years old or older compared to newer vehicles, sport utility vehicles compared to other passenger vehicles, and traveling over 30 miles per hour compared to vehicles traveling at lower speeds. GAO also found that NHTSA does not consistently collect detailed data on the type and severity of pedestrian injuries, but began a pilot program in 2018 to improve its data collection efforts. NHTSA, however, lacks an evaluation plan with criteria to assess whether to expand the pilot program, as called for in leading practices. As a result, NHTSA lacks information to determine how and whether it should expand the pilot to meet the agency's data needs. Automakers offer a range of approaches to address pedestrian safety. For example, pedestrian crash avoidance technologies use cameras or radar to detect an imminent crash with a pedestrian and engage a vehicle's brakes to avoid a crash. GAO found that about 60 percent of the model year 2019 vehicles offered in the United States by 13 automakers had pedestrian crash avoidance technologies as standard or optional equipment. In 2015 NHTSA proposed pedestrian safety tests for its New Car Assessment Program (NCAP), but NHTSA has not decided whether it will include such tests in the program. NHTSA has reported that crash avoidance technologies could lead to a decrease in pedestrian fatalities. Nine automakers that GAO interviewed reported that NHTSA's lack of communication about pedestrian safety tests creates challenges for new product development. NHTSA has also not documented a clear process for updating NCAP with milestones for decisions. NHTSA officials said that updating NCAP involves many actions and can take years. However, absent a final decision on whether to include pedestrian safety tests in NCAP and a documented process for making such decisions, the public lacks clarity on NHTSA's efforts to address safety risks. GAO is recommending that NHTSA (1) develop an evaluation plan with criteria for expanding its pilot program, (2) make and communicate a decision about whether to include pedestrian safety tests in NCAP, and (3) document the process for making changes to NCAP. The Department of Transportation concurred with our recommendations.",

Factors influencing these fatalities include pedestrian exposure, roadway type\u2014most deaths occur on high-speed urban arterial roads\u2014and risky behaviors like distracted driving or walking, with most fatalities happening after dark and away from intersections. National data on walking suggest a modest increase in commuters traveling by foot. To address pedestrian safety, automakers have introduced active safety features\u2014like pedestrian automatic emergency braking that uses cameras and radar to detect and respond to pedestrians\u2014and passive safety features such as energy-absorbing bumpers and hoods. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) administers programs like the New Car Assessment Program (NCAP) and sets minimum safety standards (FMVSS), but U.S. NCAP currently does not test or rate vehicles for pedestrian crash avoidance, nor does it recommend pedestrian automatic emergency braking. Internationally, the U.S. has participated in developing global technical regulations to improve pedestrian safety by requiring vehicles to better absorb impact in collisions, though the U.S. has not adopted these standards. Other countries, such as those in Europe and Japan, integrate pedestrian safety tests into their new car assessment programs, and U.S. organizations like IIHS and AAA have also begun testing pedestrian crash avoidance systems, using these results to inform consumer information and safety awards.",

Most fatalities occur after dark and away from intersections. Vehicle manufacturers have added active safety features (like pedestrian automatic emergency braking using cameras and radar) and passive features (like energy absorbing bumpers and hoods) to mitigate incidents and injuries. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) rates vehicle safety through the NCAP program, but currently does not consider pedestrian safety in its ratings or recommend pedestrian-specific crash avoidance features. Though the U.S. signed onto a 1998 international agreement for global technical regulations (including energy-absorbing car hoods and bumpers for pedestrian safety), it has not enacted corresponding rules. Other countries (e.g., Europe, Japan) have made pedestrian safety testing central to their assessment programs, and non-government organizations in the U.S. have started similar testing, but federal regulations and testing have not kept pace.

In 2008, pedestrian fatalities accounted for approximately 12 percent of all highway fatalities; by 2018, this proportion had risen to approximately 17 percent. The estimated number of pedestrians injured in vehicular crashes likewise rose from about 71,000 in 2008 to nearly 79,800 in 2018. Various factors contribute to pedestrian fatalities, including the extent of pedestrian exposure to traffic, roadway design, and both driver and pedestrian behaviors\u2014particularly distracted behavior associated with cell phone use. Data on pedestrian exposure is limited at the national level but is more accessible at state and local levels. National surveys indicate a modest increase in walking as a mode of commuting between 2010 and 2018.\n\nAnalysis of fatality data reveals that most pedestrian deaths occur in urban environments on principal arterial roads with high traffic volumes and speeds. Fatalities predominantly take place after dark and at non-intersection locations; in 2018, approximately 75 percent of pedestrian fatalities occurred after dark and 73 percent at non-intersection sites.\n\nAutomobile manufacturers have introduced both active (\"crash avoidance\") and passive (\"crash mitigation\") safety technologies to address pedestrian risks. Active safety features\u2014such as pedestrian automatic emergency braking systems\u2014utilize sensors to detect pedestrians and can alert drivers or initiate braking. Passive features include vehicle design modifications, such as energy-absorbing bumpers and reconfigured hoods, that aim to reduce injury severity upon impact.\n\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) manages the New Car Assessment Program (NCAP), federal motor vehicle safety standards (FMVSS), and a specific federal bumper standard. NCAP conducts crashworthiness and, since 2010, recommends various safety technologies to consumers, though these recommendations do not currently include pedestrian automatic emergency braking, nor do pedestrian safety evaluations feature in NCAP ratings. FMVSS establishes minimum safety performance benchmarks, while the bumper standard covers front/rear bumpers of passenger cars (excluding multipurpose vehicles).\n\nInternationally, the U.S. participates in the United Nations\u2019 process for developing global technical vehicle regulations, including Global Technical Regulation No. 9, which targets improvements in vehicle front-end design for enhanced pedestrian protection. However, NHTSA has not initiated the adoption of these global standards domestically.\n\nOther jurisdictions, such as Europe and Japan, have incorporated pedestrian protection tests into their new car assessment programs. Furthermore, nongovernmental organizations in the U.S.\u2014notably the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) and the American Automobile Association (AAA)\u2014have undertaken and published pedestrian crash avoidance system tests.

Here\u2019s the gist of what the document is saying, in a way you might explain to a friend:\n\nSince 2008, not only have more pedestrians been killed in traffic crashes, but the percentage of pedestrian deaths compared to all highway deaths has gone up too. Back in 2008, pedestrians made up about 12% of all highway fatalities, but by 2018, that number was about 17%. Injuries to pedestrians also went up during that time.\n\nA bunch of things play into this problem, like how many people are actually out walking, how roads are designed, and the behaviors of both drivers and pedestrians (think: distracted driving or walking, especially with cell phones). Most pedestrian fatalities happen in urban areas, especially on big, busy roads, and often at night or outside of intersections.\n\nCar companies have started adding technologies to help prevent pedestrian accidents\u2014like systems that can automatically hit the brakes if they sense a person in front of the car. There are also vehicle features designed to make the car less harmful if it does hit someone (like softer bumpers).\n\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) rates cars on safety through their 5-star system, but right now, pedestrian safety features aren\u2019t part of those ratings. They also have minimum safety standards for cars, but those don\u2019t specifically focus on pedestrians either. While the U.S. has agreed internationally to consider regulations that would make cars safer for pedestrians, those rules haven\u2019t been adopted in the U.S. yet.\n\nMeanwhile, Europe and Japan have already been testing cars specifically for pedestrian safety, including how well cars can avoid hitting someone or reduce the harm if they do. Some U.S. organizations, like the IIHS and AAA, have also started testing cars for pedestrian safety and using those results in their car safety awards.\n\nSo, in summary: Pedestrian deaths are up and still a big issue, some new tech in cars aims to help, but the U.S. is a bit behind other countries in making pedestrian safety a big part of official vehicle ratings and regulations.",

This report (1) describes how HHS, USDA, and EPA ensure researchers consider the use of alternatives to animals and (2) examines the steps the agencies have taken to facilitate the use of alternative research methods and to assess the effect of their efforts on animal use. GAO reviewed documents, such as agency policies and practices relevant to the consideration of alternatives and interviewed agency officials. GAO also interviewed representatives of a nongeneralizable sample of 12 federal and nonfederal research facilities randomly selected across agencies and facilities. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) use a variety of methods to ensure researchers consider alternatives to animal use in research (see figure). Two of these methods are (1) requiring researchers to obtain approval of their research protocols, including their consideration of alternatives, from their institutions, and (2) calling for or recommending researchers to use database searches to identify alternatives. HHS and USDA also help ensure that researchers consider alternatives through the agencies' oversight of research facilities. For example, USDA is to conduct annual inspections of nonfederal research facilities. Futhermore, the agencies have provided training to researchers on the consideration of alternatives. HHS, USDA, and EPA have facilitated the development and use of alternatives to animal use in research through individual and collaborative efforts. These efforts include agency strategies and policies for promoting the use of alternative methods and the development of testing methods that rely on non-animal models. Additionally, the agencies are members of the Interagency Coordinating Committee on the Validation of Alternative Methods, which is managed by HHS's National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. The committee promotes testing methods that protect human health and the environment while reducing animal use. The interagency committee's 2018 strategic roadmap calls for it to identify appropriate metrics for monitoring progress and measuring success in adopting alternatives. However, the committee and its member agencies have not routinely developed or reported metrics that demonstrate how their efforts to encourage the use of alternative methods affect animal use. They have also not designated an interagency workgroup to address the challenges related to developing and reporting such metrics. Facilitating the establishment of such a workgroup would help the committee and its member agencies better monitor their progress across the range of their efforts to reduce animal use and report members' progress to the public. GAO recommends that HHS's National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences facilitate the establishment of an interagency workgroup to develop metrics for assessing progress on the development and promotion of alternatives to animal use and incorporate those metrics into public reports.

It details both intra-agency (internal/federal facilities) and inter-agency (external/universities, private sector) research arrangements, as well as the development and enforcement of regulatory guidelines for the humane treatment of animals used in research, testing, and teaching.\n\nThe USDA\u2019s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), under the Animal Welfare Act (AWA), is responsible for the inspection and oversight of research institutions to ensure compliance with humane standards for covered species of warm-blooded animals. Facilities must establish animal care and use committees tasked with the semiannual review of animal care programs, the approval of research protocols\u2014including a mandatory assessment of alternatives to potentially painful procedures\u2014and the submission of annual reports attesting to the consideration of such alternatives.\n\nWithin HHS, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) administers guidelines under the Health Research Extension Act of 1985 and the Public Health Service Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. These requirements extend to all vertebrate species and emphasize minimizing animal use and distress through institutional assurance statements, personnel training, adherence to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and site visits for compliance evaluation.\n\nLegislative initiatives have further promoted the development and validation of alternative methods to animal use. The NIH Revitalization Act of 1993 and subsequent establishment of the Interagency Coordinating Committee on the Validation of Alternative Methods (ICCVAM) underscore federal efforts to advance and standardize alternatives that replace, reduce, or refine the use of animals in research. The ICCVAM Authorization Act of 2000 solidified ICCVAM's role as a permanent body for the evaluation and promotion of alternatives, mandating biennial progress reporting across participating agencies. The 2016 Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act requires the EPA to actively reduce and replace vertebrate animal testing in chemical safety evaluation, and to develop a strategic plan to accomplish these objectives.\n\nOverall, the document delineates a multi-agency, legislative, and regulatory framework that prioritizes the ethical oversight of animal research, mandates consideration and implementation of alternatives wherever possible, and fosters ongoing interagency coordination to ensure continuous improvement in animal welfare practices within federally funded and regulated research settings.",

          "summary": "Sure! Here\u2019s a friendly summary you could give to a friend:\n\nSo basically, federal agencies like the USDA, HHS (which includes the NIH), and EPA are really involved in how animal research gets done in the U.S. They do things like fund research at both government labs and universities, set rules for testing products on animals, and make sure animals used in research are treated humanely.\n\nOne big law here is the Animal Welfare Act, which the USDA enforces. It covers the humane treatment of animals like dogs, cats, monkeys, rabbits, etc., when used for research. Research facilities have to set up animal care committees that regularly inspect how animals are treated and check whether researchers have considered alternatives to using animals\u2014like computer models or cell cultures\u2014especially if the experiment might hurt the animal.\n\nThe NIH has its own rules too, and their guidance includes all vertebrate animals\u2014so mice and fish get covered too! If a university or lab wants NIH funding, they\u2019ve got to prove they train their people on animal welfare and on using as few animals as possible. They also need to follow something called the \u201cGuide,\u201d which basically says: always look for better or less invasive ways before using animals.\n\nThere are also efforts at the national level to find new ways to avoid using animals in research whenever possible. Congress set up a special committee (ICCVAM) in the \u201890s to help evaluate and encourage alternative testing methods. This group brings together folks from 15 different agencies to push for new technologies that either use fewer animals, make the research less painful for them, or replace animals entirely (like using computer models or less sentient species).\n\nEPA also has rules for chemical testing that encourage using alternatives to animal testing and requires a plan for developing these alternatives.\n\nIn a nutshell, these agencies not only fund and regulate animal research\u2014they also work hard to make sure researchers are always thinking about alternatives that reduce the use and suffering of animals, and that new and better testing methods are being developed and adopted.",

One of them wants his buddy\u2014who\u2019s just sitting around\u2014to get up and talk to a woman there. But the buddy refuses, saying she looks \u201ctoo intellectual\u201d and not his type. He admits he wants an old-fashioned, super-affectionate woman who\u2019ll basically take care of all his needs at home\u2014cook, clean, watch the kids, that sort of thing\u2014while he just comes home, eats, watches TV, and maybe takes out the trash.\n\nHis friend is pretty shocked and tells him that times have changed, and those expectations aren\u2019t realistic or fair. He even mentions a news report saying lots of women feel their husbands don\u2019t help enough at home. The two guys briefly compare their \u201cideal women\u201d\u2014one wants someone more traditional and dependent, the other prefers someone outgoing, caring, and accepting of differences. In the end, the first guy basically resigns himself to going home alone to his TV dinner and his dog, while his friend jokes that if he keeps hanging out with him, it\u2019s going to be a boring night.\n\nIn short, it\u2019s a funny but pointed back-and-forth about outdated and modern expectations of relationships!",
