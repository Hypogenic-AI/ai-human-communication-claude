Congress faces decisions regarding the approval or modification of these programs, which could impact future military capabilities. The report highlights the evolution of EW in response to emerging threats from technologically advanced adversaries like Russia and China, emphasizing the need for robust EW systems. The Army and Marine Corps have developed various EW programs, including counter-IED and counter-UAS systems, with a focus on integrating new technologies such as lasers and artificial intelligence. Challenges include balancing funding and capabilities between counter-IED missions and great power competition, as well as tracking the complex funding associated with classified EW programs. Emerging technologies, including quantum communications, may further transform EW operations. Overall, the report underscores the importance of advancing EW capabilities to maintain U.S. military superiority in an increasingly contested electromagnetic environment.",

Key issues included inadequate training and evaluation of inspectors, failure to track inspection schedules, and the manipulation of scoring systems by property owners. REAC had not reviewed its inspection process since 2001, leading to concerns about the reliability of inspections. The report recommended that REAC resume calculating sampling errors in inspection scores to better identify properties needing enforcement actions. HUD agreed to this recommendation but had not fully implemented it by November 2019. Additionally, weaknesses in REAC's training programs and performance evaluations for inspectors were noted, with recommendations for establishing formal assessment mechanisms and continuing education requirements. HUD has since begun implementing some changes, including a new contracting model for inspections and developing continuing education requirements. The report also addressed HUD's lead paint compliance monitoring, revealing limitations in enforcement and data tracking.

These programs cater to individuals beyond high school and are crucial for filling jobs that require skills but not a degree. Despite over $100 billion in federal financial aid available annually, most of it does not support non-degree programs, which are increasingly in demand due to a rising number of jobs requiring postsecondary education but not a degree. Various proposals, including the College Affordability Act, aim to expand Pell Grant eligibility for these programs. Concerns exist regarding the quality and effectiveness of some non-degree programs, with evidence suggesting that they may not significantly enhance employment or earnings compared to high school graduates. Additionally, the federal government currently lacks comprehensive oversight of these programs. The report outlines existing federal programs and benefits that support non-degree education, highlighting gaps in funding and quality assurance.

Despite these efforts, over 20 million Americans still lack broadband access as of 2019, largely due to lower demand in rural regions, which discourages private investment. A 2015 study highlighted that while infrastructure is crucial, increasing demand in underserved areas is equally important. Factors such as lower income, older populations, and lower educational attainment contribute to reduced broadband adoption rates in rural households compared to urban ones. The document discusses various federal programs, primarily from the USDA and FCC, that focus on supply-side support for broadband infrastructure, but notes that many of these programs do not adequately address demand-side issues. The report emphasizes the uneven geographic and demographic distribution of broadband demand, suggesting that while some rural areas may attract investment, others remain unattractive to providers. It also highlights the need for Congress to consider options that promote broadband adoption, such as enhancing the Lifeline program and improving outreach and education efforts to raise awareness of broadband benefits. Ultimately, achieving universal broadband access in rural areas requires addressing both infrastructure and demand-side barriers.",

The establishment of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in 2003 further reshaped border security funding. Under the Trump Administration, Executive Order 13767 emphasized the construction of a physical wall, leading to substantial appropriations for border barriers. The document outlines various funding sources and legislative actions taken from FY2017 to FY2020, revealing a total of $4.47 billion appropriated for border barrier planning and construction.

    "summary": "The Department of the Interior oversees mineral extraction on federal lands through various bureaus, primarily the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) for onshore activities and the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management for offshore activities. Companies must secure leases and permits to drill for oil and gas, with compliance monitored by the Office of Natural Resources Revenue (ONRR). ONRR's compliance program includes audits, reviews, and data mining to ensure accurate royalty payments. Recent assessments highlight the need for ONRR to establish clearer compliance goals, improve case selection processes, and better track contributions from state partners to enhance royalty collection accuracy. Seven recommendations for improvement were made, all of which Interior agreed to implement.",

    "summary": "The U.S. Department of the Interior oversees mineral extraction activities on federal lands, with the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) managing onshore oil and gas leases and the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management handling offshore activities. As of 2016, BLM managed around 41,000 oil and gas leases covering 28.2 million acres. Companies must secure permits to drill, ensuring compliance with environmental regulations. The Office of Natural Resources Revenue (ONRR) monitors royalty payments from these leases, requiring companies to submit monthly production and royalty reports. ONRR employs audits, compliance reviews, and data mining to verify royalty accuracy, but its compliance goals have shifted from ensuring accuracy to focusing on efficiency, raising concerns about the adequacy of royalty collection. Recommendations include establishing an accuracy goal, developing a documented case selection process, and requiring state partners to align their compliance activities with ONRR\u2019s goals. Additionally, ONRR should analyze its risk model for case selection effectiveness and track state contributions to compliance goals. The Department of the Interior has agreed to implement these recommendations to improve oversight and ensure accurate royalty payments from oil and gas extraction.",
