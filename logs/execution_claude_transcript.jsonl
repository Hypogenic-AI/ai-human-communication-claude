Excellent! All files are in place. Let me provide a final summary of the research completed:

## Research Session Complete

I have completed a full research cycle investigating **AI-to-Human Communication Strategies**. Here's a summary of what was accomplished:

### Completed Phases

1. **Resource Review**: Analyzed 11 papers from the literature review, 3 datasets (FeedSum, CNN/DailyMail, Human-Like-DPO), and 3 code repositories

2. **Experimental Planning**: Created detailed methodology in `planning.md` testing 4 hypotheses about communication formats

3. **Environment Setup**: Created isolated Python 3.10 environment with uv, installed all dependencies

4. **Data Preparation**: Sampled 20 diverse documents from FeedSum across 7 domains (dialogue, news, medical, government reports, etc.)

5. **Implementation**: Built complete experimental pipeline:
   - `src/prompts.py`: 7 communication strategies (dense prose, concise, bullet points, structured sections, progressive hierarchy, formal, conversational)
   - `src/generate_summaries.py`: GPT-4.1 API integration
   - `src/evaluate.py`: LLM-as-judge evaluation on 5 dimensions
   - `src/analyze.py`: ANOVA, t-tests, effect sizes, visualizations

6. **Experimentation**: Generated 140 summaries (20 docs x 7 strategies), ran 200 evaluations (140 multi-dimensional + 60 pairwise comparisons)

7. **Analysis**: Computed statistical tests, created 4 visualizations, generated summary report

### Key Results

| Strategy | Overall Score | Key Insight |
|----------|---------------|-------------|
| **Progressive Hierarchy** | 4.85/5 | 95% pairwise win rate vs. dense prose |
| **Structured Sections** | 4.85/5 | Best conciseness (4.95) |
| Formal Technical | 4.70/5 | 80% win rate vs. conversational |
| Dense Prose (baseline) | 4.60/5 | - |
| Concise | 4.15/5 | Sacrifices completeness (3.50) |

### Main Conclusions

1. **Structure matters more than content alone** - Bullet points and progressive disclosure dramatically outperform prose
2. **Optimal length is 130-200 words** - Balances completeness and conciseness
3. **Formal tone preferred** for informational content (80% win rate)
4. **Faithfulness maintained** across all formats (no significant difference)

### Output Files

- `REPORT.md`: Comprehensive research report with actual results
- `README.md`: Project overview and reproduction instructions
- `results/figures/`: 4 visualization plots
- `results/*.json`: Raw data and statistical analysis
- `src/*.py`: Reproducible experimental code
