Resource gathering phase is complete. Here's a summary of what was accomplished:

## Resource Finding Complete

### Papers Downloaded: 11
Key topics covered:
- Progressive disclosure & transparency (Springer & Whittaker 2018)
- Task-supportive human-LLM interaction (Wang et al. 2024)
- Text summarization with LLMs (survey + evaluation methods)
- Cognitive ergonomics in LLM design
- FeedSum: Multi-dimensional feedback for summarization
- Agentic information retrieval
- Streaming LLM cognitive load

### Datasets Downloaded: 3
1. **FeedSum** (125K samples) - Multi-dimensional feedback (faithfulness, completeness, conciseness) for training human-preferred summarizers
2. **CNN/DailyMail** (11.5K test) - Standard news summarization benchmark
3. **Human-Like-DPO** (10.9K samples) - Human-like vs formal response preferences for style optimization

### Code Repositories Cloned: 3
1. **SumLLM** - Training summarization with LLM references
2. **llm-summarization-evaluation** - Document summarization pipeline
3. **saga-llm-evaluation** - G-Eval, SelfCheck-GPT, and other metrics

### Documentation Created
- `literature_review.md` - Comprehensive synthesis of papers
- `resources.md` - Full resource catalog with recommendations
- `papers/README.md` - Paper descriptions
- `datasets/README.md` - Download instructions and usage
- `code/README.md` - Repository documentation
- `.resource_finder_complete` - Completion marker

The experiment runner can now use these resources to conduct research on making AI-to-human communication more effective.
