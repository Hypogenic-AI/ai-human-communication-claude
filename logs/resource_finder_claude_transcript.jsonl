Resource finding is now complete. Here's a summary of what was accomplished:

## Resource Finding Complete

### Papers (11 PDFs)
All papers were already downloaded covering:
- Progressive disclosure and transparency design
- Human-LLM interaction and cognitive load
- Text summarization with LLMs
- Evaluation metrics for summarization quality
- Cognitive ergonomics in LLM systems

### Datasets (3 downloaded, ~209MB total)
| Dataset | Size | Samples | Purpose |
|---------|------|---------|---------|
| FeedSum | 164MB | 125K train + 1.4K test | Multi-dimensional feedback (faithfulness, completeness, conciseness) |
| CNN/DailyMail | 30MB | 11.5K test | Standard news summarization benchmark |
| Human-Like-DPO | 15MB | 10.9K | Human-like vs formal response preferences |

### Code Repositories (3 cloned)
1. **SumLLM** - Training summarization models with LLM references
2. **llm-summarization-evaluation** - Document summarization pipeline
3. **saga-llm-evaluation** - Comprehensive evaluation metrics (G-Eval, SelfCheck)

### Deliverables Created
- `literature_review.md` - Synthesis of all papers with recommendations
- `resources.md` - Complete resource catalog with usage guidance
- `datasets/*/samples.json` - Sample data files for each dataset
- `.resource_finder_complete` - Completion marker

The workspace is ready for the experiment runner phase.
